                       &ldquo;Let us now praise famous men&rdquo;&mdash;
                        Men of little showing&mdash;
                       For their work continueth,
                       And their work continueth,
                        Greater than their knowing.

                       Western wind and open surge
                        Tore us from our mothers;
                       Flung us on a naked shore
                       (Twelve bleak houses by the shore!
                       Seven summers by the shore!)
                        'Mid two hundred brothers.

                       There we met with famous men
                        Set in office o'er us.
                       And they beat on us with rods&mdash;
                       Faithfully with many rods&mdash;
                       Daily beat us on with rods&mdash;
                        For the love they bore us!

                       Out of Egypt unto Troy&mdash;
                        Over Himalaya&mdash;
                       Far and sure our bands have gone&mdash;
                       Hy-Brasil or Babylon,
                       Islands of the Southern Run,
                        And cities of Cathaia!

                       And we all praise famous men&mdash;
                        Ancients of the College;
                       For they taught us common sense&mdash;-
                       Tried to teach us common sense&mdash;
                       Truth and God's Own Common Sense
                        Which is more than knowledge!

                       Each degree of Latitude
                        Strung about Creation
                       Seeth one (or more) of us,
                       (Of one muster all of us&mdash;
                       Of one master all of us&mdash;)
                        Keen in his vocation.

                       This we learned from famous men
                        Knowing not its uses
                       When they showed in daily work
                       Man must finish off his work&mdash;
                       Right or wrong, his daily work&mdash;
                        And without excuses.

                       Servants of the staff and chain,
                        Mine and fuse and grapnel&mdash;
                       Some before the face of Kings,
                       Stand before the face of Kings;
                       Bearing gifts to divers Kings&mdash;
                        Gifts of Case and Shrapnel.

                       This we learned from famous men
                        Teaching in our borders.
                       Who declare'd it was best,
                       Safest, easiest and best&mdash;
                       Expeditious, wise and best&mdash;
                        To obey your orders.

                       Some beneath the further stars
                        Bear the greater burden.
                       Set to serve the lands they rule,
                       (Save he serve no man may rule)
                       Serve and love the lands they rule;
                        Seeking praise nor guerdon.

                       This we learned from famous men
                        Knowing not we learned it.
                       Only, as the years went by&mdash;
                       Lonely, as the years went by&mdash;
                       Far from help as years went by
                        Plainer we discerned it.

                       Wherefore praise we famous men
                        From whose bays we borrow&mdash;
                       They that put aside Today&mdash;
                       All the joys of their Today&mdash;
                       And with toil of their Today
                        Bought for us Tomorrow!

                       Bless and praise we famous men
                        Men of little showing!
                       For their work continueth
                       And their work continueth
                       Broad and deep continueth
                        Great beyond their knowing!

    <h2>
      &ldquo;IN AMBUSH.&rdquo;
     </h2>
    <p>
      In summer all right-minded boys built huts in the furze-hill behind the
      College&mdash;little lairs whittled out of the heart of the prickly
      bushes, full of stumps, odd root-ends, and spikes, but, since they were
      strictly forbidden, palaces of delight. And for the fifth summer in
      succession, Stalky, McTurk, and Beetle (this was before they reached the
      dignity of a study) had built like beavers a place of retreat and
      meditation, where they smoked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, there was nothing in their characters as known to Mr. Prout, their
      house-master, at all commanding respect; nor did Foxy, the subtle
      red-haired school Sergeant, trust them. His business was to wear
      tennis-shoes, carry binoculars, and swoop hawklike upon evil boys. Had he
      taken the field alone, that hut would have been raided, for Foxy knew the
      manners of his quarry; but Providence moved Mr. Prout, whose school-name,
      derived from the size of his feet, was Hoofer, to investigate on his own
      account; and it was the cautious Stalky who found the track of his pugs on
      the very floor of their lair one peaceful afternoon when Stalky would fain
      have forgotten Prout and his works in a volume of Surtees and a new
      briar-wood pipe. Crusoe, at sight of the footprint, did not act more
      swiftly than Stalky. He removed the pipes, swept up all loose match-ends,
      and departed to warn Beetle and McTurk.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it was characteristic of the boy that he did not approach his allies
      till he had met and conferred with little Hartopp, President of the
      Natural History Society, an institution which Stalky held in contempt,
      Hartopp was more than surprised when the boy meekly, as he knew how,
      begged to propose himself, Beetle, and McTurk as candidates; confessed to
      a long-smothered interest in first-flowerings, early butterflies, and new
      arrivals, and volunteered, if Mr. Hartopp saw fit, to enter on the new
      life at once. Being a master, Hartopp was suspicious; but he was also an
      enthusiast, and his gentle little soul had been galled by chance-heard
      remarks from the three, and specially Beetle. So he was gracious to that
      repentant sinner, and entered the three names in his book.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, and not till then, did Stalky seek Beetle and McTurk in their house
      form-room. They were stowing away books for a quiet afternoon in the
      furze, which they called the &ldquo;wuzzy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All up,&rdquo; said Stalky, serenely. &ldquo;I spotted Heffy's fairy feet round our
      hut after dinner. 'Blessing they're so big.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Con-found! Did you hide our pipes?&rdquo; said Beetle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no. Left 'em in the middle of the hut, of course. What a blind ass
      you are, Beetle! D'you think nobody thinks but yourself? Well, we can't
      use the hut any more. Hoofer will be watchin' it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Bother! Likewise blow!'&rdquo; said McTurk thoughtfully, unpacking the volumes
      with which his chest was cased. The boys carried their libraries between
      their belt and their collar. &ldquo;Nice job! This means we're under suspicion
      for the rest of the term.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why? All that Heffy has found is a hut. He and Foxy will watch it. It's
      nothing to do with us; only we mustn't be seen that way for a bit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and where else are we to go?&rdquo; said Beetle. &ldquo;You chose that place,
      too&mdash;an'&mdash;an' I wanted to read this afternoon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Stalky sat on a desk drumming his heels on the form.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're a despondin' brute, Beetle. Sometimes I think I shall have to drop
      you altogether. Did you ever know your Uncle Stalky forget you yet? <i>His
      rebus infectis</i>&mdash;after I'd seen Heffy's man-tracks marchin' round
      our hut, I found little Hartopp&mdash;<i>destricto ense</i>&mdash;wavin' a
      butterfly-net. I conciliated Hartopp. 'Told him that you'd read papers to
      the Bug-hunters if he'd let you join, Beetle. 'Told him you liked
      butterflies, Turkey. Anyhow, I soothed the Hartoffles, and we're
      Bug-hunters now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's the good of that?&rdquo; said Beetle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Turkey, kick him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In the interests of science bounds were largely relaxed for the members of
      the Natural History Society. They could wander, if they kept clear of all
      houses, practically where they chose; Mr. Hartopp holding himself
      responsible for their good conduct.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beetle began to see this as McTurk began the kicking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm an ass, Stalky!&rdquo; he said, guarding the afflicted part. &ldquo;<i>Pax</i>,
      Turkey. I'm an ass.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't stop, Turkey. Isn't your Uncle Stalky a great man?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Great man,&rdquo; said Beetle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All the same bug-huntin's a filthy business,&rdquo; said McTurk. &ldquo;How the deuce
      does one begin?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This way,&rdquo; said Stalky, turning to some fags' lockers behind him. &ldquo;Fags
      are dabs at Natural History. Here's young Braybrooke's botany-case.&rdquo; He
      flung out a tangle of decayed roots and adjusted the slide. &ldquo;'Gives one no
      end of a professional air, I think. Here's Clay Minor's geological hammer.
      Beetle can carry that. Turkey, you'd better covet a butterfly-net from
      somewhere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm blowed if I do,&rdquo; said McTurk, simply, with immense feeling. &ldquo;Beetle,
      give me the hammer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right. I'm not proud. Chuck us down that net on top of the lockers,
      Stalky.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's all right. It's a collapsible jamboree, too. Beastly luxurious
      dogs these fags are. Built like a fishin'-rod. 'Pon my sainted Sam, but we
      look the complete Bug-hunters! Now, listen to your Uncle Stalky! We're
      goin' along the cliffs after butterflies. Very few chaps come there. We're
      goin' to leg it, too. You'd better leave your book behind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not much!&rdquo; said Beetle, firmly. &ldquo;I'm not goin' to be done out of my fun
      for a lot of filthy butterflies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you'll sweat horrid. You'd better carry my Jorrocks. 'Twon't make
      you any hotter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They all sweated; for Stalky led them at a smart trot west away along the
      cliffs under the furze-hills, crossing combe after gorzy combe. They took
      no heed to flying rabbits or fluttering fritillaries, and all that Turkey
      said of geology was utterly unquotable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are we going to Clovelly?&rdquo; he puffed at last, and they flung themselves
      down on the short, springy turf between the drone of the sea below and the
      light summer wind among the inland trees. They were looking into a combe
      half full of old, high furze in gay bloom that ran up to a fringe of
      brambles and a dense wood of mixed timber and hollies. It was as though
      one-half the combe were filled with golden fire to the cliff's edge. The
      side nearest to them was open grass, and fairly bristled with
      notice-boards.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fee-rocious old cove, this,&rdquo; said Stalky, reading the nearest. &ldquo;'<i>Prosecuted
      with the utmost rigour of the law</i>. G. M. Dabney, Col., J.P.,' an' all
      the rest of it. 'Don't seem to me that any chap in his senses would
      trespass here, does it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You've got to prove damage 'fore you can prosecute for anything! 'Can't
      prosecute for trespass,&rdquo; said McTurk, whose father held many acres in
      Ireland. &ldquo;That's all rot!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Glad of that, 'cause this looks like what we wanted. Not straight across,
      Beetle, you blind lunatic! Anyone could spot us half a mile off. This way;
      and furl up your beastly butterfly-net.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Beetle disconnected the ring, thrust the net into a pocket, shut up the
      handle to a two-foot stave, and slid the cane-ring round his waist. Stalky
      led inland to the wood, which was, perhaps, a quarter of a mile from the
      sea, and reached the fringe of the brambles.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Now</i> we can get straight down through the furze, and never show up
      at all,&rdquo; said the tactician. &ldquo;Beetle, go ahead and explore. Snf! Snf!
      Beastly stink of fox somewhere!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On all fours, save when he clung to his spectacles, Beetle wormed into the
      gorse, and presently announced between grunts of pain that he had found a
      very fair fox-track. This was well for Beetle, since Stalky pinched him <i>a
      tergo</i>. Down that tunnel they crawled. It was evidently a highway for
      the inhabitants of the combe; and, to their inexpressible joy, ended, at
      the very edge of the cliff, in a few square feet of dry turf walled and
      roofed with impenetrable gorse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By gum! There isn't a single thing to do except lie down,&rdquo; said Stalky,
      returning a knife to his pocket. &ldquo;Look here!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He parted the tough stems before him, and it was as a window opened on a
      far view of Lundy, and the deep sea sluggishly nosing the pebbles a couple
      of hundred feet below. They could hear young jackdaws squawking on the
      ledges, the hiss and jabber of a nest of hawks somewhere out of sight;
      and, with great deliberation, Stalky spat on to the back of a young rabbit
      sunning himself far down where only a cliff-rabbit could have found
      foot-hold. Great gray and black gulls screamed against the jackdaws; the
      heavy-scented acres of bloom round them were alive with low-nesting birds,
      singing or silent as the shadow of the wheeling hawks passed and returned;
      and on the naked turf across the combe rabbits thumped and frolicked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whew! What a place! Talk of natural history; this is it,&rdquo; said Stalky,
      filling himself a pipe. &ldquo;Isn't it scrumptious? Good old sea!&rdquo; He spat
      again approvingly, and was silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      McTurk and Beetle had taken out their books and were lying on their
      stomachs, chin in hand. The sea snored and gurgled; the birds, scattered
      for the moment by these new animals, returned to their businesses, and the
      boys read on in the rich, warm, sleepy silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hullo, here's a keeper,&rdquo; said Stalky, shutting &ldquo;Handley Cross&rdquo;
       cautiously, and peering through the jungle. A man with a gun appeared on
      the sky-line to the east. &ldquo;Confound him, he's going to sit down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He'd swear we were poachin', too,&rdquo; said Beetle. &ldquo;What's the good of
      pheasants' eggs? They're always addled, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Might as well get up to the wood, I think,&rdquo; said Stalky. &ldquo;We don't want
      G. M. Dabney, Col., J.P., to be bothered about us so soon. Up the wuzzy
      and keep quiet! He may have followed us, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Beetle was already far up the tunnel. They heard him gasp indescribably:
      there was the crash of a heavy body leaping through the furze.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aie! yeou little red rascal. I see yeou!&rdquo; The keeper threw the gun to his
      shoulder, and fired both barrels in their direction. The pellets dusted
      the dry stems round them as a big fox plunged between Stalky's legs, and
      ran over the cliff-edge.
    </p>
    <p>
      They said nothing till they reached the wood, torn, disheveled, hot, but
      unseen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Narrow squeak,&rdquo; said Stalky. &ldquo;I'll swear some of the pellets went through
      my hair.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you see him?&rdquo; said Beetle. &ldquo;I almost put my hand on him. Wasn't he a
      wopper! Didn't he stink! Hullo, Turkey, what's the matter? Are you hit?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      McTurk's lean face had turned pearly white; his mouth, generally half
      open, was tight shut, and his eyes blazed. They had never seen him like
      this save once in a sad time of civil war.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know that that was just as bad as murder?&rdquo; he said, in a grating
      voice, as he brushed prickles from his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, he didn't hit us,&rdquo; said Stalky. &ldquo;I think it was rather a lark.
      Here, where are you going?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm going up to the house, if there is one,&rdquo; said McTurk, pushing through
      the hollies. &ldquo;I am going to tell this Colonel Dabney.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you crazy? He'll swear it served us jolly well right. He'll report
      us. It'll be a public lickin'. Oh, Turkey, don't be an ass! Think of us!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You fool!&rdquo; said McTurk, turning savagely. &ldquo;D'you suppose I'm thinkin' of
      <i>us</i>? It's the keeper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's cracked,&rdquo; said Beetle, miserably, as they followed. Indeed, this was
      a new Turkey&mdash;a haughty, angular, nose-lifted Turkey&mdash;whom they
      accompanied through a shrubbery on to a lawn, where a white-whiskered old
      gentleman with a cleek was alternately putting and blaspheming vigorously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you Colonel Dabney?&rdquo; McTurk began in this new creaking voice of his.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I am, and&mdash;&rdquo; his eyes traveled up and down the boy&mdash;&ldquo;who&mdash;what
      the devil d'you want? Ye've been disturbing my pheasants. Don't attempt to
      deny it. Ye needn't laugh at it.&rdquo; (McTurk's not too lovely features had
      twisted themselves into a horrible sneer at the word pheasant.) &ldquo;You've
      been birds'-nesting. You needn't hide your hat. I can see that you belong
      to the College. Don't attempt to deny it. Ye do! Your name and number at
      once, sir. Ye want to speak to me&mdash;Eh? You saw my notice-boards? Must
      have. Don't attempt to deny it. Ye did! Damnable, oh damnable!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He choked with emotion. McTurk's heel tapped the lawn and he stuttered a
      little&mdash;two sure signs that he was losing his temper. But why should
      he, the offender, be angry?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lo-look here, sir. Do&mdash;do you shoot foxes? Because, if you don't,
      your keeper does. We've seen him! I do-don't care what you call us&mdash;but
      it's an awful thing. It's the ruin of good feelin' among neighbors. A
      ma-man ought to say once and for all how he stands about preservin'. It's
      worse than murder, because there's no legal remedy.&rdquo; McTurk was quoting
      confusedly from his father, while the old gentleman made noises in his
      throat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know who I am?&rdquo; he gurgled at last; Stalky and Beetle quaking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sorr, nor do I care if ye belonged to the Castle itself. Answer me
      now, as one gentleman to another. Do ye shoot foxes or do ye not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And four years before Stalky and Beetle had carefully kicked McTurk out of
      his Irish dialect! Assuredly he had gone mad or taken a sunstroke, and as
      assuredly he would be slain&mdash;once by the old gentleman and once by
      the Head. A public licking for the three was the least they could expect.
      Yet&mdash;if their eyes and ears were to be trusted&mdash;the old
      gentleman had collapsed. It might be a lull before the storm, but&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not.&rdquo; He was still gurgling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you must sack your keeper. He's not fit to live in the same county
      with a God-fearin' fox. An' a vixen, too&mdash;at this time o' year!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did ye come up on purpose to tell me this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I did, ye silly man,&rdquo; with a stamp of the foot. &ldquo;Would you not
      have done as much for me if you'd seen that thing happen on my land, now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Forgotten&mdash;forgotten was the College and the decency due to elders!
      McTurk was treading again the barren purple mountains of the rainy West
      coast, where in his holidays he was viceroy of four thousand naked acres,
      only son of a three-hundred-year-old house, lord of a crazy fishing-boat,
      and the idol of his father's shiftless tenantry. It was the landed man
      speaking to his equal&mdash;deep calling to deep&mdash;and the old
      gentleman acknowledged the cry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I apologize,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I apologize unreservedly&mdash;to you, and to the
      Old Country. Now, will you be good enough to tell me your story?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We were in your combe,&rdquo; McTurk began, and he told his tale alternately as
      a schoolboy and, when the iniquity of the thing overcame him, as an
      indignant squire; concluding: &ldquo;So you see he must be in the habit of it. I&mdash;we&mdash;-one
      never wants to accuse a neighbor's man; but I took the liberty in this
      case&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see. Quite so. For a reason ye had. Infamous&mdash;-oh, infamous!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The two had fallen into step beside each other on the lawn, and Colonel
      Dabney was talking as one man to another. &ldquo;This comes of promoting a
      fisherman&mdash;a fisherman&mdash;from his lobster-pots. It's enough to
      ruin the reputation of an archangel. Don't attempt to deny it. It is! Your
      father has brought you up well. He has. I'd much like the pleasure of his
      acquaintance. Very much, indeed. And these young gentlemen? English they
      are. Don't attempt to deny it. They came up with you, too? Extraordinary!
      Extraordinary, now! In the present state of education I shouldn't have
      thought any three boys would be well enough grounded. But out of the
      mouths of&mdash;No&mdash;no! Not that by any odds. Don't attempt to deny
      it. Ye're not! Sherry always catches me under the liver, but&mdash;beer,
      now? Eh? What d'you say to beer, and something to eat? It's long since I
      was a boy&mdash;abominable nuisances; but exceptions prove the rule. And a
      vixen, too!&rdquo; They were fed on the terrace by a gray-haired housekeeper.
      Stalky and Beetle merely ate, but McTurk with bright eyes continued a free
      and lofty discourse; and ever the old gentleman treated him as a brother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear man, of course ye can come again. Did I not say exceptions prove
      the rule? The lower combe? Man, dear, anywhere ye please, so long as you
      do not disturb my pheasants. The two are not incompatible. Don't attempt
      to deny it. They're not! I'll never allow another gun, though. Come and go
      as ye please. I'll not see you, and ye needn't see me. Ye've been well
      brought up. Another glass of beer, now? I tell you a fisherman he was and
      a fisherman he shall be to-night again. He shall! Wish I could drown him.
      I'll convoy you to the Lodge. My people are not precisely&mdash;ah&mdash;broke
      to boy, but they'll know you again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He dismissed them with many compliments by the high Lodge-gate in the
      split-oak park palings and they stood still; even Stalky, who had played
      second, not to say a dumb, fiddle, regarding McTurk as one from another
      world. The two glasses of strong home-brewed had brought a melancholy upon
      the boy, for, slowly strolling with his hands in his pockets, he crooned:&mdash;&ldquo;Oh,
      Paddy dear, and did ye hear the news that's goin' round?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Under other circumstances Stalky and Beetle would have fallen upon him,
      for that song was barred utterly&mdash;anathema&mdash;the sin of
      witchcraft. But seeing what he had wrought, they danced round him in
      silence, waiting till it pleased him to touch earth.
    </p>
    <p>
      The tea-bell rang when they were still half a mile from College. McTurk
      shivered and came out of dreams. The glory of his holiday estate had left
      him. He was a Colleger of the College, speaking English once more.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Turkey, it was immense!&rdquo; said Stalky, generously. &ldquo;I didn't know you had
      it in you. You've got us a hut for the rest of the term, where we simply
      <i>can't</i> be collared. Fids! Fids! Oh, Fids! I gloat! Hear me gloat!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They spun wildly on their heels, jodeling after the accepted manner of a
      &ldquo;gloat,&rdquo; which is not unremotely allied to the primitive man's song of
      triumph, and dropped down the hill by the path from the gasometer just in
      time to meet their house-master, who had spent the afternoon watching
      their abandoned hut in the &ldquo;wuzzy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Unluckily, all Mr. Prout's imagination leaned to the darker side of life,
      and he looked on those young-eyed cherubims most sourly. Boys that he
      understood attended house-matches and could be accounted for at any
      moment. But he had heard McTurk openly deride cricket&mdash;even
      house-matches; Beetle's views on the honor of the house he knew were
      incendiary; and he could never tell when the soft and smiling Stalky was
      laughing at him. Consequently&mdash;since human nature is what it is&mdash;those
      boys had been doing wrong somewhere. He hoped it was nothing very serious,
      but...
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Ti-ra-ra-la-i-tu</i>! I gloat! Hear me!&rdquo; Stalky, still on his heels,
      whirled like a dancing dervish to the dining-hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Ti-ra-la-la-i-tu</i>! I gloat! Hear me!&rdquo; Beetle spun behind him with
      outstretched arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Ti-ra-la-la-i-tu</i>! I gloat! Hear me!&rdquo; McTurk's voice cracked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now was there or was there not a distinct flavor of beer as they shot past
      Mr. Prout?
    </p>
    <p>
      He was unlucky in that his conscience as a house-master impelled him to
      consult his associates. Had he taken his pipe and his troubles to little
      Hartopp's rooms he would, perhaps, have been saved confusion, for Hartopp
      believed in boys, and knew something about them. His fate led him to King,
      a fellow house-master, no friend of his, but a zealous hater of Stalky
      &amp; Co.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah-haa!&rdquo; said King, rubbing his hands when the tale was told. &ldquo;Curious!
      Now <i>my</i> house never dream of doing these things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you see I've no proof, exactly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Proof? With the egregious Beetle! As if one wanted it! I suppose it is
      not impossible for the Sergeant to supply it? Foxy is considered at least
      a match for any evasive boy in my house. Of course they were smoking and
      drinking somewhere. That type of boy always does. They think it manly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But they've no following in the school, and they are distinctly&mdash;er
      brutal to their juniors,&rdquo; said Prout, who had from a distance seen Beetle
      return, with interest, his butterfly-net to a tearful fag.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! They consider themselves superior to ordinary delights.
      Self-sufficient little animals! There's something in McTurk's Hibernian
      sneer that would make me a little annoyed. And they are so careful to
      avoid all overt acts, too. It's sheer calculated insolence. I am strongly
      opposed, as you know, to interfering with another man's house; but they
      need a lesson, Prout. They need a sharp lesson, if only to bring down
      their over-weening self-conceit. Were I you, I should devote myself for a
      week to their little performances. Boys of that order&mdash;and I may
      flatter myself, but I think I know boys&mdash;don't join the Bug-hunters
      for love. Tell the Sergeant to keep his eye open; and, of course, in my
      peregrinations I may casually keep mine open, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Ti-ra-la-la-i-tu</i>! I gloat! Hear me!&rdquo; far down the corridor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Disgusting!&rdquo; said King. &ldquo;Where do they pick up these obscene noises? One
      sharp lesson is what they want.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The boys did not concern themselves with lessons for the next few days.
      They had all Colonel Dabney's estate to play with, and they explored it
      with the stealth of Red Indians and the accuracy of burglars. They could
      enter either by the Lodge-gates on the upper road&mdash;they were careful
      to ingratiate themselves with the Lodge-keeper and his wife&mdash;drop
      down into the combe, and return along the cliffs; or they could begin at
      the combe and climb up into the road.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were careful not to cross the Colonel's path&mdash;he had served his
      turn, and they would not out-wear their welcome&mdash;nor did they show up
      on the sky-line when they could move in cover. The shelter of the gorze by
      the cliff-edge was their chosen retreat. Beetle christened it the Pleasant
      Isle of Aves, for the peace and the shelter of it; and here, the pipes and
      tobacco once cache'd in a convenient ledge an arm's length down the cliff,
      their position was legally unassailable.
    </p>
    <p>
      For, observe, Colonel Dabney had not invited them to enter his house.
      Therefore, they did not need to ask specific leave to go visiting; and
      school rules were strict on that point. He had merely thrown open his
      grounds to them; and, since they were lawful Bug-hunters, their extended
      bounds ran up to his notice-boards in the combe and his Lodge-gates on the
      hill.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were amazed at their own virtue.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And even if it wasn't,&rdquo; said Stalky, flat on his back, staring into the
      blue. &ldquo;Even suppose we were miles out of bounds, no one could get at us
      through this wuzzy, unless he knew the tunnel. Isn't this better than
      lyin' up just behind the Coll.&mdash;in a blue funk every time we had a
      smoke? Isn't your Uncle Stalky&mdash;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Beetle&mdash;he was stretched at the edge of the cliff spitting
      thoughtfully. &ldquo;We've got to thank Turkey for this. Turkey is the Great
      Man. Turkey, dear, you're distressing Heffles.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gloomy old ass!&rdquo; said McTurk, deep in a book.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They've got us under suspicion,&rdquo; said Stalky. &ldquo;Hoophats <i>is</i> so
      suspicious somehow; and Foxy always makes every stalk he does a sort of&mdash;sort
      of&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Scalp,&rdquo; said Beetle. &ldquo;Foxy's a giddy Chingangook.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor Foxy,&rdquo; said Stalky. &ldquo;He's goin' to catch us one of these days. 'Said
      to me in the Gym last night, 'I've got my eye on you, Mister Corkran. I'm
      only warning you for your good.' Then I said: 'Well, you jolly well take
      it off again, or you'll get into trouble. I'm only warnin' you for your
      good.' Foxy was wrath.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but it's only fair sport for Foxy,&rdquo; said Beetle. &ldquo;It's Hefflelinga
      that has the evil mind. 'Shouldn't wonder if he thought we got tight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never got squiffy but once&mdash;that was in the holidays,&rdquo; said
      Stalky, reflectively; &ldquo;an' it made me horrid sick. 'Pon my sacred Sam,
      though, it's enough to drive a man to drink, havin' an animal like Hoof
      for house-master.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If we attended the matches an' yelled, 'Well hit, sir,' an' stood on one
      leg an' grinned every time Heffy said, 'So ho, my sons. Is it thus?' an'
      said, 'Yes, sir,' an' 'No, sir,' an' 'O, sir,' an' 'Please, sir,' like a
      lot o' filthy fa-ags, Heffy 'ud think no end of us,&rdquo; said McTurk with a
      sneer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Too late to begin that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's all right. The Hefflelinga means well. <i>But</i> he is an ass. <i>And</i>
      we show him that we think he's an ass. An' <i>so</i> Heffy don't love us.
      'Told me last night after prayers that he was <i>in loco parentis</i>,&rdquo;
       Beetle grunted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The deuce he did!&rdquo; cried Stalky. &ldquo;That means he's maturin' something
      unusual dam' mean. Last time he told me that he gave me three hundred
      lines for dancin' the cachuca in Number Ten dormitory. <i>Loco parentis</i>,
      by gum! But what's the odds as long as you're 'appy? <i>We're</i> all
      right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They were, and their very rightness puzzled Prout, King, and the Sergeant.
      Boys with bad consciences show it. They slink out past the Fives Court in
      haste, and smile nervously when questioned. They return, disordered, in
      bare time to save a call-over. They nod and wink and giggle one to the
      other, scattering at the approach of a master. But Stalky and his allies
      had long out-lived these manifestations of youth. They strolled forth
      unconcernedly, and returned in excellent shape after a light refreshment
      of strawberries and cream at the Lodge.
    </p>

      The Lodge-keeper had been promoted to keeper, <i>vice</i> the murderous
      fisherman, and his wife made much of the boys. The man, too, gave them a
      squirrel, which they presented to the Natural History Society; thereby
      checkmating little Hartopp, who wished to know what they were doing for
      Science. Foxy faithfully worked some deep Devon lanes behind a lonely
      cross-roads inn; and it was curious that Prout and King, members of
      Common-room seldom friendly, walked together in the same direction&mdash;that
      is to say, northeast.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, the Pleasant Isle of Aves lay due southwest. &ldquo;They're deep&mdash;day-vilish
      deep,&rdquo; said Stalky. &ldquo;Why are they drawin' those covers?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Me,&rdquo; said Beetle sweetly. &ldquo;I asked Foxy if he had ever tasted the beer
      there. That was enough for Foxy, and it cheered him up a little. He and
      Heffy were sniffin' round our old hut so long I thought they'd like a
      change.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it can't last forever,&rdquo; said Stalky. &ldquo;Heffy's bankin' up like a
      thunder-cloud, an' King goes rubbin' his beastly hands, an' grinnin' like
      a hyena. It's shockin' demoralizin' for King. He'll burst some day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That day came a little sooner than they expected&mdash;came when the
      Sergeant, whose duty it was to collect defaulters, did not attend an
      afternoon call-over.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tired of pubs, eh? He's gone up to the top of the bill with his
      binoculars to spot us,&rdquo; said Stalky. &ldquo;Wonder he didn't think of that
      before. Did you see old Heffy cock his eye at us when we answered our
      names? Heffy's in it, too. <i>Ti-ra-la-la-i-tu</i>! I gloat! Hear me! Come
      on!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aves?&rdquo; said Beetle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, but I'm not smokin' <i>aujourd'hui</i>. <i>Parceque je</i>
      jolly well <i>pense</i> that we'll be <i>suivi</i>. We'll go along the
      cliffs, slow, an' give Foxy lots of time to parallel us up above.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They strolled towards the swimming-baths, and presently overtook King.
      &ldquo;Oh, don't let <i>me</i> interrupt you,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Engaged in scientific
      pursuits, of course? I trust you will enjoy yourselves, my young friends.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see!&rdquo; said Stalky, when they were out of earshot. &ldquo;He <i>can't</i>
      keep a secret. He's followin' to cut off our line of retreat. He'll wait
      at the baths till Heffy comes along. They've tried every blessed place
      except along the cliffs, and now they think they've bottled us. No need to
      hurry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They walked leisurely over the combes till they reached the line of
      notice-boards.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen a shake. Foxy's up wind comin' down hill like beans. When you hear
      him move in the bushes, go straight across to Aves. They want to catch us
      <i>flagrante delicto</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They dived into the gorse at right angles to the tunnel, openly crossing
      the grass, and lay still in Aves.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did I tell you?&rdquo; Stalky carefully put away the pipes and tobacco.
      The Sergeant, out of breath, was leaning against the fence, raking the
      furze with his binoculars, but he might as well have tried to see through
      a sand-bag. Anon, Prout and King appeared behind him. They conferred.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aha! Foxy don't like the notice-boards, and he don't like the prickles
      either. Now we'll cut up the tunnel and go to the Lodge. Hullo! They've
      sent Foxy into cover.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Sergeant was waist-deep in crackling, swaying furze, his ears filled
      with the noise of his own progress. The boys reached the shelter of the
      wood and looked down through a belt of hollies.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hellish noise!&rdquo; said Stalky, critically. &ldquo;'Don't think Colonel Dabney
      will like it. I move we go into the Lodge and get something to eat. We
      might as well see the fun out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly the keeper passed them at a trot. &ldquo;Who'm they to combe-bottom for
      Lard's sake? Master'll be crazy,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poachers simly,&rdquo; Stalky replied in the broad Devon that was the boy's <i>langue
      de guerre</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll poach 'em to raights!&rdquo; He dropped into the funnel-like combe, which
      presently began to fill with noises, notably King's voice crying: &ldquo;Go on,
      Sergeant! Leave him alone, you, sir. He is executing my orders.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who'm yeou to give arders here, gingy whiskers? Yeou come up to the
      master. Come out o' that wuzzy! [This is to the Sergeant.] Yiss, I reckon
      us knows the boys yeou'm after. They've tu long ears an' vuzzy bellies,
      an' you nippies they in yeour pockets when they'm dead. Come on up to
      master! He'll boy yeou all you're a mind to. Yeou other folk bide your
      side fence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Explain to the proprietor. You can explain, Sergeant,&rdquo; shouted King.
      Evidently the Sergeant had surrendered to the major force.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beetle lay at full length on the turf behind the Lodge, literally biting
      the earth in spasms of joy. Stalky kicked him upright. There was nothing
      of levity about Stalky or McTurk save a stray muscle twitching on the
      cheek.
    </p>
    <p>
      They tapped at the Lodge door, where they were always welcome. &ldquo;Come yeou
      right in an' set down, my little dearrs,&rdquo; said the woman. &ldquo;They'll niver
      touch my man. He'll poach 'em to rights. Iss fai! Fresh berries an' cream.
      Us Dartymoor folk niver forgit their friends. But them Bidevor poachers,
      they've no hem to their garments. Sugar? My man he've digged a badger for
      yeou, my dearrs. 'Tis in the linhay in a box.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Us'll take un with us when we're finished here. I reckon yeou'm busy.
      We'll bide here an'&mdash;'tis washin' day with yeou, simly,&rdquo; said Stalky.
      &ldquo;We'm no company to make all vitty for. Never yeou mind us. Yiss. There's
      plenty cream.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The woman withdrew, wiping her pink hands on her apron, and left them in
      the parlor. There was a scuffle of feet on the gravel outside the
      heavily-leaded diamond panes, and then the voice of Colonel Dabney,
      something clearer than a bugle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ye can read? You've eyes in your head? Don't attempt to deny it. Ye
      have!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Beetle snatched a crochet-work antimacassar from the shiny horsehair sofa,
      stuffed it into his mouth, and rolled out of sight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You saw my notice-boards. Your duty? Curse your impudence, sir. Your duty
      was to keep off my grounds. Talk of duty to <i>me</i>! Why&mdash;why&mdash;why,
      ye misbegotten poacher, ye'll be teaching me my A B C next! Roarin' like a
      bull in the bushes down there! Boys? Boys? Boys? Keep your boys at home,
      then! I'm not responsible for your boys! But I don't believe it&mdash;I
      don't believe a word of it. Ye've a furtive look in your eye&mdash;a
      furtive, sneakin', poachin' look in your eye, that 'ud ruin the reputation
      of an archangel! Don't attempt to deny it! Ye have! A sergeant? More shame
      to you, then, an' the worst bargain Her Majesty ever made! A sergeant, to
      run about the country poachin'&mdash;on your pension! Damnable! Oh,
      damnable! But I'll be considerate. I'll be merciful. By gad, I'll be the
      very essence o' humanity! Did ye, or did ye not, see my notice-boards?
      Don't attempt to deny it! Ye did. Silence, Sergeant!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Twenty-one years in the army had left their mark on Foxy. He obeyed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now. March!&rdquo; The high Lodge gate shut with a clang. &ldquo;My duty! A sergeant
      to tell me my duty!&rdquo; puffed Colonel Dabney. &ldquo;Good Lard! more sergeants!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's King! It's King!&rdquo; gulped Stalky, his head on the horsehair pillow.
      McTurk was eating the rag-carpet before the speckless hearth, and the sofa
      heaved to the emotions of Beetle. Through the thick glass the figures
      without showed blue, distorted, and menacing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I protest against this outrage.&rdquo; King had evidently been running
      up hill. &ldquo;The man was entirely within his duty. Let&mdash;let me give you
      my card.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's in flannels!&rdquo; Stalky buried his head again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unfortunately&mdash;most unfortunately&mdash;I have not one with me, but
      my name is King, sir, a house-master of the College, and you will find me
      prepared&mdash;fully prepared&mdash;to answer for this man's action. We've
      seen three&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did ye see my notice-boards?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I admit we did; but under the circumstances&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I stand <i>in loco parentis</i>.&rdquo; Prout's deep voice was added to the
      discussion. They could hear him pant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;F'what?&rdquo; Colonel Dabney was growing more and more Irish.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm responsible for the boys under my charge.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ye are, are ye? Then all I can say is that ye set them a very bad example&mdash;a
      dam' bad example, if I may say so. I do not own your boys. I've not seen
      your boys, an' I tell you that if there was a boy grinnin' in every bush
      on the place, <i>still</i> ye've no shadow of a right here, comin' up from
      the combe that way, an' frightenin' everything in it. Don't attempt to
      deny it. Ye did. Ye should have come to the Lodge an' seen me like
      Christians, instead of chasin' your dam' boys through the length and
      breadth of my covers. <i>In loco parentis</i> ye are? Well, I've not
      forgotten my Latin either, an' I'll say to you: '<i>Quis custodiet ipsos
      custodes</i>.' If the masters trespass, how can we blame the boys?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But if I could speak to you privately,&rdquo; said Prout.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll have nothing private with you! Ye can be as private as ye please on
      the other side o' that gate an'&mdash;I wish ye a very good afternoon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A second time the gate clanged. They waited till Colonel Dabney had
      returned to the house, and fell into one another's arms, crowing for
      breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, my Soul! Oh, my King! Oh, my Heffy! Oh, my Foxy! Zeal, all zeal, Mr.
      Simple.&rdquo; Stalky wiped his eyes. &ldquo;Oh! Oh I Oh!&mdash;'I <i>did</i> boil the
      exciseman!' We must get out of this or we'll be late for tea.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ge&mdash;Ge&mdash;get the badger and make little Hartopp happy. Ma&mdash;ma&mdash;make
      'em all happy,&rdquo; sobbed McTurk, groping for the door and kicking the
      prostrate Beetle before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      They found the beast in an evil-smelling box, left two half-crowns for
      payment, and staggered home. Only the badger grunted most marvelous like
      Colonel Dabney, and they dropped him twice or thrice with shrieks of
      helpless laughter. They were but imperfectly recovered when Foxy met them
      by the Fives Court with word that they were to go up to their dormitory
      and wait till sent for.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, take this box to Mr. Hartopp's rooms, then. We've done something
      for the Natural History Society, at any rate,&rdquo; said Beetle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Fraid that won't save you, young gen'elmen,&rdquo; Foxy answered, in an awful
      voice. He was sorely ruffled in his mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All sereno, Foxibus.&rdquo; Stalky had reached the extreme stage of hiccups.
      &ldquo;We&mdash;we'll never desert you, Foxy. Hounds choppin' foxes in cover is
      more a proof of vice, ain't it?... No, you're right. I'm&mdash;I'm not
      quite well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They've gone a bit too far this time,&rdquo; Foxy thought to himself. &ldquo;Very far
      gone, <i>I'd</i> say, excep' there was no smell of liquor. An' yet it
      isn't like 'em&mdash;somehow. King and Prout they 'ad their dressin'-down
      same as me. That's one comfort.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, we must pull up,&rdquo; said Stalky, rising from the bed on which he had
      thrown himself. &ldquo;We're injured innocence&mdash;as usual. We don't know
      what we've been sent up here for, do we?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No explanation. Deprived of tea. Public disgrace before the house,&rdquo; said
      McTurk, whose eyes were running over. &ldquo;It's dam' serious.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, hold on, till King loses his temper,&rdquo; said Beetle. &ldquo;He's a libelous
      old rip, an' he'll be in a ravin' paddy-wack. Prout's too beastly
      cautious. Keep your eye on King, and, if he gives us a chance, appeal to
      the Head. That always makes 'em sick.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They were summoned to their house-master's study, King and Foxy supporting
      Prout, and Foxy had three canes under his arm. King leered triumphantly,
      for there were tears, undried tears of mirth, on the boys' cheeks. Then
      the examination began.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, they had walked along the cliffs. Yes, they had entered Colonel
      Dabney's grounds. Yes, they had seen the notice-boards (at this point
      Beetle sputtered hysterically). For what purpose had they entered Colonel
      Dabney's grounds? &ldquo;Well, sir, there was a badger.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here King, who loathed the Natural History Society because he did not like
      Hartopp, could no longer be restrained. He begged them not to add
      mendacity to open insolence. But the badger was in Mr. Hartopp's rooms,
      sir. The Sergeant had kindly taken it up for them. That disposed of the
      badger, and the temporary check brought King's temper to boiling-point.
      They could hear his foot on the floor while Prout prepared his lumbering
      inquiries. They had settled into their stride now. Their eyes ceased to
      sparkle; their faces were blank; their hands hung beside them without a
      twitch. They were learning, at the expense of a fellow-countryman, the
      lesson of their race, which is to put away all emotion and entrap the
      alien at the proper time.
    </p>
    <p>
      So far good. King was importing himself more freely into the trial, being
      vengeful where Prout was grieved. They knew the penalties of trespassing?
      With a fine show of irresolution, Stalky admitted that he had gathered
      some information vaguely bearing on this head, but he thought&mdash;The
      sentence was dragged out to the uttermost: Stalky did not wish to play his
      trump with such an opponent. Mr. King desired no buts, nor was he
      interested in Stalky's evasions. They, on the other hand, might be
      interested in his poor views. Boys who crept&mdash;who sneaked&mdash;who
      lurked&mdash;out of bounds, even the generous bounds of the Natural
      History Society, which they had falsely joined as a cloak for their
      misdeeds&mdash;their vices&mdash;their villainies&mdash;their immoralities&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He'll break cover in a minute,&rdquo; said Stalky to himself. &ldquo;Then we'll run
      into him before he gets away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Such boys, scabrous boys, moral lepers&mdash;the current of his words was
      carrying King off his feet&mdash;evil-speakers, liars, slow-bellies&mdash;yea,
      incipient drunkards...
    </p>
    <p>
      He was merely working up to a peroration, and the boys knew it; but McTurk
      cut through the frothing sentence, the others echoing:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I appeal to the Head, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I appeal to the head, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I appeal to the Head, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was their unquestioned right. Drunkenness meant expulsion after a
      public flogging. They had been accused of it. The case was the Head's, and
      the Head's alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thou hast appealed unto Caesar: unto Caesar shalt thou go.&rdquo; They had
      heard that sentence once or twice before in their careers. &ldquo;None the
      less,&rdquo; said King, uneasily, &ldquo;you would be better advised to abide by our
      decision, my young friends.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are we allowed to associate with the rest of the school till we see the
      Head, sir?&rdquo; said McTurk to his house-master, disregarding King. This at
      once lifted the situation to its loftiest plane. Moreover, it meant no
      work, for moral leprosy was strictly quarantined, and the Head never
      executed judgment till twenty-four cold hours later.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;er&mdash;if you persist in your defiant attitude,&rdquo; said King,
      with a loving look at the canes under Foxy's arm. &ldquo;There is no
      alternative.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ten minutes later the news was over the whole school. Stalky and Co. had
      fallen at last&mdash;fallen by drink. They had been drinking. They had
      returned blind-drunk from a hut. They were even now lying hopelessly
      intoxicated on the dormitory floor. A few bold spirits crept up to look,
      and received boots about the head from the criminals.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We've got him&mdash;got him on the Caudine Toasting-fork!&rdquo; said Stalky,
      after those hints were taken. &ldquo;King'll have to prove his charges up to the
      giddy hilt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Too much ticklee, him bust,&rdquo; Beetle quoted from a book of his reading.
      &ldquo;Didn't I say he'd go pop if we lat un bide?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No prep., either, O ye incipient drunkards,&rdquo; said McTurk, &ldquo;and it's trig
      night, too. Hullo! Here's our dear friend Foxy. More tortures, Foxibus?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've brought you something to eat, young gentlemen,&rdquo; said the Sergeant
      from behind a crowded tray. Their wars had ever been waged without malice,
      and a suspicion floated in Foxy's mind that boys who allowed themselves to
      be tracked so easily might, perhaps, hold something in reserve. Foxy had
      served through the Mutiny, when early and accurate information was worth
      much.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I noticed you 'adn't 'ad anything to eat, an' I spoke to Gumbly,
      an' he said you wasn't exactly cut off from supplies. So I brought up
      this. It's your potted 'am tin, ain't it, Mr. Corkran?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Foxibus, you're a brick,&rdquo; said Stalky. &ldquo;I didn't think you had this
      much&mdash;what's the word, Beetle?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bowels,&rdquo; Beetle replied, promptly. &ldquo;Thank you, Sergeant. That's young
      Carter's potted ham, though.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There was a C on it. I thought it was Mr. Corkran's. This is a very
      serious business, young gentlemen. That's what it is. I didn't know,
      perhaps, but there might be something on your side which you hadn't said
      to Mr. King or Mr. Prout, maybe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is. Heaps, Foxibus.&rdquo; This from Stalky through a full mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you see, if that was the case, it seemed to me I might represent it,
      quiet so to say, to the 'Ead when he asks me about it. I've got to take
      'im the charges to-night, an'&mdash;it looks bad on the face of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Trocious bad, Foxy. Twenty-seven cuts in the Gym before all the school,
      and public expulsion. 'Wine is a mocker, strong drink is ragin','&rdquo; quoth
      Beetle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's nothin' to make fun of, young gentlemen. I 'ave to go to the 'Ead
      with the charges. An'&mdash;an' you mayn't be aware, per'aps, that I was
      followin' you this afternoon; havin' my suspicions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did ye see the notice-boards?&rdquo; croaked McTurk, in the very brogue of
      Colonel Dabney.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ye've eyes in your head. Don't attempt to deny it. Ye did!&rdquo; said Beetle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A sergeant! To run about poachin' on your pension! Damnable, O damnable!&rdquo;
       said Stalky, without pity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good Lord!&rdquo; said the Sergeant, sitting heavily upon a bed. &ldquo;Where&mdash;where
      the devil <i>was</i> you? I might ha' known it was a do&mdash;somewhere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you clever maniac!&rdquo; Stalky resumed. &ldquo;We mayn't be aware you were
      followin' us this afternoon, mayn't we? 'Thought you were stalkin' us, eh?
      Why, we led you bung into it, of course. Colonel Dabney&mdash;don't you
      think he's a nice man, Foxy?&mdash;Colonel Dabney's our pet particular
      friend. We've been goin' there for weeks and weeks, he invited us. You and
      your duty! Curse your duty, sir! Your duty was to keep off his covers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'll never be able to hold up your head again, Foxy. The fags 'll hoot
      at you,&rdquo; said Beetle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Think of your giddy prestige!&rdquo; The Sergeant was thinking&mdash;hard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look 'ere, young gentlemen,&rdquo; he said, earnestly. &ldquo;You aren't surely ever
      goin' to tell, are you? Wasn't Mr. Prout and Mr. King in&mdash;in it too?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Foxibusculus, they <i>was</i>. They was&mdash;singular horrid. Caught it
      worse than you. We heard every word of it. You got off easy, considerin'.
      If I'd been Dabney I swear I'd ha' quodded you. I think I'll suggest it to
      him to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An' it's all goin' up to the 'Ead. Oh, Good Lord!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Every giddy word of it, my Chingangook,&rdquo; said Beetle, dancing. &ldquo;Why
      shouldn't it? <i>We've</i> done nothing wrong. <i>We</i> ain't poachers.
      <i>We</i> didn't cut about blastin' the characters of poor, innocent boys&mdash;saying
      they were drunk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That I didn't,&rdquo; said Foxy. &ldquo;I&mdash;I only said that you be'aved uncommon
      odd when you come back with that badger. Mr. King may have taken the wrong
      hint from that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Course he did; an' he'll jolly well shove all the blame on you when he
      finds out he's wrong. We know King, if you don't. I'm ashamed of you. You
      ain't fit to be a sergeant,&rdquo; said McTurk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not with three thorough-goin' young devils like you, I ain't. I've been
      had. I've been ambuscaded. Horse, foot, an' guns, I've been had, an'&mdash;an'
      there'll be no holdin' the junior forms after this. M'rover, the 'Ead will
      send me with a note to Colonel Dabney to ask if what you say about bein'
      invited was true.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you'd better go in by the Lodge-gates this time, instead of chasin'
      your dam' boys&mdash;oh, that was the Epistle to King&mdash;so it was.
      We-el, Foxy?&rdquo; Stalky put his chin on his hands and regarded the victim
      with deep delight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Ti-ra-la-la-i-tu</i>! I gloat! Hear me!&rdquo; said McTurk. &ldquo;Foxy brought us
      tea when we were moral lepers. Foxy has a heart. Foxy has been in the
      Army, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish I'd ha' had you in my company, young gentlemen,&rdquo; said the Sergeant
      from the depths of his heart; &ldquo;I'd ha' given you something.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Silence at drum-head court-martial,&rdquo; McTurk went on. &ldquo;I'm advocate for
      the prisoner; and, besides, this is much too good to tell all the other
      brutes in the Coll. They'd <i>never</i> understand. They play cricket, and
      say: 'Yes sir,' and 'O, sir,' and 'No, sir.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind that. Go ahead,&rdquo; said Stalky.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Foxy's a good little chap when he does not esteem himself so as to
      be clever.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Take not out your 'ounds on a werry windy day,'&rdquo; Stalky struck in. &ldquo;<i>I</i>
      don't care if you let him off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nor me,&rdquo; said Beetle. &ldquo;Heffy is my only joy&mdash;Heffy and King.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I 'ad to do it,&rdquo; said the Sergeant, plaintively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Right, O! Led away by bad companions in the execution of his duty or&mdash;or
      words to that effect. You're dismissed with a reprimand, Foxy. <i>We</i>
      won't tell about <i>you</i>. I swear we won't,&rdquo; McTurk concluded. &ldquo;Bad for
      the discipline of the school. Horrid bad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the Sergeant, gathering up the tea-things, &ldquo;knowin' what I
      know o' the young dev&mdash;gentlemen of the College, I'm very glad to
      'ear it. But what am I to tell the 'Ead?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anything you jolly well please, Foxy. We aren't the criminals.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To say that the Head was annoyed when the Sergeant appeared after dinner
      with the day's crime-sheet would be putting it mildly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Corkran, McTurk, and Co., I see. Bounds as usual. Hullo! What the deuce
      is this? Suspicion of drinking. Whose charge??&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. King's, sir. I caught 'em out of bounds, sir: at least that was 'ow
      it looked. But there's a lot be'ind, sir.&rdquo; The Sergeant was evidently
      troubled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go on,&rdquo; said the Head. &ldquo;Let us have your version.&rdquo; He and the Sergeant
      had dealt with one another for some seven years; and the Head knew that
      Mr. King's statements depended very largely on Mr. King's temper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought they were out of bounds along the cliffs. But it come out they
      wasn't, sir. I saw them go into Colonel Dabney's woods, and&mdash;Mr. King
      and Mr. Prout come along&mdash;and the fact was, sir, we was mistook for
      poachers by Colonel Dabney's people&mdash;Mr. King and Mr. Prout and me.
      There were some words, sir, on both sides. The young gentlemen slipped
      'ome somehow, and they seemed 'ighly humorous, sir. Mr. King was mistook
      by Colonel Dabney himself&mdash;Colonel Dabney bein' strict. Then they
      preferred to come straight to you, sir, on account of what&mdash;what Mr.
      King may 'ave said about their 'abits afterwards in Mr. Prout's study. I
      only said they was 'ighly humorous, laughin' an' gigglin', an' a bit above
      'emselves. They've since told me, sir, in a humorous way, that they was
      invited by Colonel Dabney to go into 'is woods.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see. They didn't tell their house-master that, of course?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They took up Mr. King on appeal just as soon as he spoke about their&mdash;'abits.
      Put in the appeal at once, sir, an' asked to be sent to the dormitory
      waitin' for you. I've since gathered, sir, in their humorous way, sir,
      that some'ow or other they've 'eard about every word Colonel Dabney said
      to Mr. King and Mr. Prout when he mistook 'em for poachers. I&mdash;I
      might ha' known when they led me on so that they 'eld the inner line of
      communications. It's&mdash;it's a plain do, sir, if you ask me; an'
      they're gloatin' over it in the dormitory.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Head saw&mdash;saw even to the uttermost farthing&mdash;and his mouth
      twitched a little under his mustache.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Send them to me at once, Sergeant. This case needn't wait over.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good evening,&rdquo; said he when the three appeared under escort. &ldquo;I want your
      undivided attention for a few minutes. You've known me for five years, and
      I've known you for&mdash;twenty-five. I think we understand one another
      perfectly. I am now going to pay you a tremendous compliment (the brown
      one, please, Sergeant. Thanks. You needn't wait). I'm going to execute you
      without rhyme, Beetle, or reason. I know you went to Colonel Dabney's
      covers because you were invited. I'm not even going to send the Sergeant
      with a note to ask if your statement is true; because I am convinced that
      on this occasion you have adhered strictly to the truth. I know, too, that
      you were not drinking. (You can take off that virtuous expression, McTurk,
      or I shall begin to fear you don't understand me.) There is not a flaw in
      any of your characters. And that is why I am going to perpetrate a howling
      injustice. Your reputations have been injured, haven't they? You have been
      disgraced before the house, haven't you? You have a peculiarly keen regard
      for the honor of your house, haven't you? Well, now I am going to lick
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Six apiece was their portion upon that word.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And this I think&rdquo;&mdash;the Head replaced the cane, and flung the written
      charge into the waste-paper basket&mdash;&ldquo;covers the situation. When you
      find a variation from the normal&mdash;this will be useful to you in later
      life&mdash;always meet him in an abnormal way. And that reminds me. There
      are a pile of paper-backs on that shelf. You can borrow them if you put
      them back. I don't think they'll take any harm from being read in the
      open. They smell of tobacco rather. You will go to prep. this evening as
      usual. Good-night,&rdquo; said that amazing man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-night, and thank you, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I swear I'll pray for the Head to-night,&rdquo; said Beetle. &ldquo;Those last two
      cuts were just flicks on my collar. There's a 'Monte Cristo' in that lower
      shelf. I saw it. Bags I, next time we go to Aves!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dearr man!&rdquo; said McTurk. &ldquo;No gating. No impots. No beastly questions. All
      settled. Hullo! what's King goin' in to him for&mdash;King and Prout?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Whatever the nature of that interview, it did not improve either King's or
      Prout's ruffled plumes, for, when they came out of the Head's house, eyes
      noted that the one was red and blue with emotion as to his nose, and that
      the other was sweating profusely. That sight compensated them amply for
      the Imperial Jaw with which they were favored by the two. It seems&mdash;and
      who so astonished as they?&mdash;that they had held back material facts;
      were guilty both of <i>suppressio veri</i> and <i>suggestio falsi</i>
      (well-known gods against whom they often offended); further, that they
      were malignant in their dispositions, untrustworthy in their characters,
      pernicious and revolutionary in their influences, abandoned to the devils
      of wilfulness, pride, and a most intolerable conceit. Ninthly, and lastly,
      they were to have a care and to be very careful.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were careful, as only boys can be when there is a hurt to be
      inflicted. They waited through one suffocating week till Prout and King
      were their royal selves again; waited till there was a house-match&mdash;their
      own house, too&mdash;in which Prout was taking part; waited, further, till
      he had his pads in the pavilion and stood ready to go forth. King was
      scoring at the window, and the three sat on a bench without.
    </p>
    <p>
      Said Stalky to Beetle: &ldquo;I say, Beetle, <i>quis custodet ipsos custodes</i>?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't ask me,&rdquo; said Beetle. &ldquo;I'll have nothin' private with you. Ye can
      be as private as ye please the other end of the bench; and I wish ye a
      very good afternoon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      McTurk yawned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, ye should ha' come up to the lodge like Christians instead o'
      chasin' your&mdash;a-hem&mdash;boys through the length an' breadth of my
      covers. <i>I</i> think these house-matches are all rot. Let's go over to
      Colonel Dabney's an' see if he's collared any more poachers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That afternoon there was joy in Aves.

    <h2>
      SLAVES OF THE LAMP
    </h2>
    <p>
      The music-room on the top floor of Number Five was filled with the
      &ldquo;Aladdin&rdquo; company at rehearsal. Dickson Quartus, commonly known as Dick
      Four, was Aladdin, stage-manager, ballet-master, half the orchestra, and
      largely librettist, for the &ldquo;book&rdquo; had been rewritten and filled with
      local allusions. The pantomime was to be given next week, in the
      down-stairs study occupied by Aladdin, Abanazar, and the Emperor of China.
      The Slave of the Lamp, with the Princess Badroulbadour and the Widow
      Twankay, owned Number Five study across the same landing, so that the
      company could be easily assembled. The floor shook to the stamp-and-go of
      the ballet, while Aladdin, in pink cotton tights, a blue and tinsel
      jacket, and a plumed hat, banged alternately on the piano and his banjo.
      He was the moving spirit of the game, as befitted a senior who had passed
      his Army Preliminary and hoped to enter Sandhurst next spring.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aladdin came to his own at last, Abanazar lay poisoned on the floor, the
      Widow Twankay danced her dance, and the company decided it would &ldquo;come all
      right on the night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What about the last song, though?&rdquo; said the Emperor, a tallish,
      fair-headed boy with a ghost of a mustache, at which he pulled manfully.
      &ldquo;We need a rousing old tune.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'John Peel'? 'Drink, Puppy, Drink'?&rdquo; suggested Abanazar, smoothing his
      baggy lilac pajamas. &ldquo;Pussy&rdquo; Abanazar never looked more than one-half
      awake, but he owned a soft, slow smile which well suited the part of the
      Wicked Uncle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stale,&rdquo; said Aladdin. &ldquo;Might as well have 'Grandfather's Clock.' What's
      that thing you were humming at prep. last night, Stalky?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Stalky, The Slave of the Lamp, in black tights and doublet, a black silk
      half-mask on his forehead, whistled lazily where he lay on the top of the
      piano. It was a catchy music-hall tune.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dick Four cocked his head critically, and squinted down a large red nose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Once more, and I can pick it up,&rdquo; he said, strumming. &ldquo;Sing the words.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Arrah, Patsy, mind the baby! Arrah, Patsy, mind the child! Wrap him in an
      overcoat, he's surely going wild! Arrah, Patsy, mind the baby! just you
      mind the child awhile! He'll kick and bite and cry all night! Arrah,
      Patsy, mind the child!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rippin'! Oh, rippin'!&rdquo; said Dick Four. &ldquo;Only we shan't have any piano on
      the night. We must work it with the banjoes&mdash;play an' dance at the
      same time. You try, Tertius.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Emperor pushed aside his pea-green sleeves of state, and followed Dick
      Four on a heavy nickel plated banjo.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but I'm dead all this time. Bung in the middle of the stage, too,&rdquo;
       said Abanazar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that's Beetle's biznai,&rdquo; said Dick Four. &ldquo;Vamp it up, Beetle. Don't
      keep us waiting all night. You've got to get Pussy out of the light
      somehow, and bring us all in dancin' at the end.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right. You two play it again,&rdquo; said Beetle, who, in a gray skirt and
      a wig of chestnut sausage-curls, set slantwise above a pair of spectacles
      mended with an old boot-lace, represented the Widow Twankay. He waved one
      leg in time to the hammered refrain, and the banjoes grew louder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Um! Ah! Er&mdash;'Aladdin now has won his wife,'&rdquo; he sang, and Dick Four
      repeated it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Your Emperor is appeased.'&rdquo; Tertius flung out his chest as he delivered
      his line.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now jump up, Pussy! Say, 'I think I'd better come to life! Then we all
      take hands and come forward: 'We hope you've all been pleased.' <i>Twiggez-vous</i>?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Nous twiggons</i>. Good enough. What's the chorus for the final
      ballet? It's four kicks and a turn,&rdquo; said Dick Four.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! Er!
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   John Short will ring the curtain down.
   And ring the prompter's bell;
   We hope you know before you go
   That we all wish you well.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rippin'! Rippin'! Now for the Widow's scene with the Princess. Hurry up,
      Turkey.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      McTurk, in a violet silk skirt and a coquettish blue turban, slouched
      forward as one thoroughly ashamed of himself. The Slave of the Lamp
      climbed down from the piano, and dispassionately kicked him. &ldquo;Play up,
      Turkey,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;this is serious.&rdquo; But there fell on the door the knock
      of authority. It happened to be King, in gown and mortar-board, enjoying a
      Saturday evening prowl before dinner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Locked doors! Locked doors!&rdquo; he snapped with a scowl. &ldquo;What's the meaning
      of this; and what, may I ask, is the intention of this&mdash;this epicene
      attire?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pantomime, sir. The Head gave us leave,&rdquo; said Abanazar, as the only
      member of the Sixth concerned. Dick Four stood firm in the confidence born
      of well-fitting tights, but Beetle strove to efface himself behind the
      piano. A gray princess-skirt borrowed from a day-boy's mother and a
      spotted cotton bodice unsystematically padded with imposition-paper make
      one ridiculous. And in other regards Beetle had a bad conscience.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As usual!&rdquo; sneered King. &ldquo;Futile foolery just when your careers, such as
      they may be, are hanging in the balance. I see! Ah, I see! The old gang of
      criminals&mdash;allied forces of disorder&mdash;Corkran&rdquo;&mdash;the Slave
      of the Lamp smiled politely&mdash;&ldquo;McTurk&rdquo;&mdash;the Irishman scowled&mdash;&ldquo;and,
      of course, the unspeakable Beetle, our friend Gigadibs.&rdquo; Abanazar, the
      Emperor, and Aladdin had more or less of characters, and King passed them
      over. &ldquo;Come forth, my inky buffoon, from behind yonder instrument of
      music! You supply, I presume, the doggerel for this entertainment. Esteem
      yourself to be, as it were, a poet?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's found one of 'em,&rdquo; thought Beetle, noting the flush on King's
      cheek-bone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have just had the pleasure of reading an effusion of yours to my
      address, I believe&mdash;an effusion intended to rhyme. So&mdash;so you
      despise me, Master Gigadibs, do you? I am quite aware&mdash;you need not
      explain&mdash;that it was ostensibly not intended for my edification. I
      read it with laughter&mdash;yes, with laughter. These paper pellets of
      inky boys&mdash;still a boy we are, Master Gigadibs&mdash;do not disturb
      my equanimity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wonder which it was,&rdquo; thought Beetle. He had launched many lampoons on an
      appreciative public ever since he discovered that it was possible to
      convey reproof in rhyme.
    </p>
    <p>
      In sign of his unruffled calm, King proceeded to tear Beetle, whom he
      called Gigadibs, slowly asunder. From his untied shoestrings to his mended
      spectacles (the life of a poet at a big school is hard) he held him up to
      the derision of his associates&mdash;with the usual result. His wild
      flowers of speech&mdash;King had an unpleasant tongue&mdash;-restored him
      to good humor at the last. He drew a lurid picture of Beetle's latter end
      as a scurrilous pamphleteer dying in an attic, scattered a few compliments
      over McTurk and Corkran, and, reminding Beetle that he must come up for
      judgment when called upon, went to Common-room, where he triumphed anew
      over his victims.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the worst of it,&rdquo; he explained in a loud voice over his soup, &ldquo;is
      that I waste such gems of sarcasm on their thick heads. It's miles above
      them, I'm certain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We-ell,&rdquo; said the school chaplain slowly, &ldquo;I don't know what Corkran's
      appreciation of your style may be, but young McTurk reads Ruskin for his
      amusement.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense! He does it to show off. I mistrust the dark Celt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He does nothing of the kind. I went into their study the other night,
      unofficially, and McTurk was gluing up the back of four odd numbers of
      'Fors Clavigera.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know anything about their private lives,&rdquo; said a mathematical
      master hotly, &ldquo;but I've learned by bitter experience that Number Five
      study are best left alone. They are utterly soulless young devils.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He blushed as the others laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      But in the music-room there were wrath and bad language. Only Stalky,
      Slave of the Lamp, lay on the piano unmoved.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That little swine Manders miner must have shown him your stuff. He's
      always suckin' up to King. Go and kill him,&rdquo; he drawled. &ldquo;Which one was
      it, Beetle?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dunno,&rdquo; said Beetle, struggling out of the skirt. &ldquo;There was one about
      his hunting for popularity with the small boys, and the other one was one
      about him in hell, tellin' the Devil he was a Balliol man. I swear both of
      'em rhymed all right. By gum! P'raps Manders minor showed him both! <i>I'll</i>
      correct his caesuras for him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He disappeared down two flights of stairs, flushed a small pink and white
      boy in a form-room next door to King's study, which, again, was
      immediately below his own, and chased him up the corridor into a form-room
      sacred to the revels of the Lower Third. Thence he came back, greatly
      disordered, to find McTurk, Stalky, and the others of the company, in his
      study enjoying an unlimited &ldquo;brew&rdquo;&mdash;coffee, cocoa, buns, new bread
      hot and steaming, sardine, sausage, ham-and-tongue paste, pilchards, three
      jams, and at least as many pounds of Devonshire cream.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My hat!&rdquo; said he, throwing himself upon the banquet. &ldquo;Who stumped up for
      this, Stalky?&rdquo; It was within a month of term end, and blank starvation had
      reigned in the studies for weeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You,&rdquo; said Stalky, serenely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Confound you! You haven't been popping my Sunday bags, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Keep your hair on. It's only your watch.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Watch! I lost it&mdash;weeks ago. Out on the Burrows, when we tried to
      shoot the old ram&mdash;the day our pistol burst.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It dropped out of your pocket (you're so beastly careless, Beetle), and
      McTurk and I kept it for you. I've been wearing it for a week, and you
      never noticed. Took it into Bideford after dinner to-day. Got thirteen and
      sevenpence. Here's the ticket.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, that's pretty average cool,&rdquo; said Abanazar behind a slab of cream
      and jam, as Beetle, reassured upon the safety of his Sunday trousers,
      showed not even surprise, much less resentment. Indeed, it was McTurk who
      grew angry, saying:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You gave him the ticket, Stalky? You pawned it? You unmitigated beast!
      Why, last month you and Beetle sold mine! 'Never got a sniff of any
      ticket.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, that was because you locked your trunk, and we wasted half the
      afternoon hammering it open. We might have pawned it if you'd behaved like
      a Christian, Turkey.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My Aunt!&rdquo; said Abanazar, &ldquo;you chaps are communists. Vote of thanks to
      Beetle, though.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's beastly unfair,&rdquo; said Stalky, &ldquo;when I took all the trouble to pawn
      it. Beetle never knew he had a watch. Oh, I say, Rabbits-Eggs gave me a
      lift into Bideford this afternoon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rabbits-Eggs was the local carrier&mdash;an outcrop of the early Devonian
      formation. It was Stalky who had invented his unlovely name. &ldquo;He was
      pretty average drunk, or he wouldn't have done it. Rabbits-Eggs is a
      little shy of me, somehow. But I swore it was <i>pax</i> between us, and
      gave him a bob. He stopped at two pubs on the way in, so he'll be howling
      drunk to-night. Oh, don't begin reading, Beetle; there's a council of war
      on. What the deuce is the matter with your collar?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Chivied Manders minor into the Lower Third box-room. 'Had all his
      beastly little friends on top of me,&rdquo; said Beetle from behind a jar of
      pilchards and a book.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You ass! Any fool could have told you where Manders would bunk to,&rdquo; said
      McTurk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn't think,&rdquo; said Beetle, meekly, scooping out pilchards with a
      spoon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Course you didn't. You never do.&rdquo; McTurk adjusted Beetle's collar with a
      savage tug. &ldquo;Don't drop oil all over my 'Fors' or I'll scrag you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shut up, you&mdash;you Irish Biddy! 'Tisn't your beastly 'Fors.' It's one
      of mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The book was a fat, brown-backed volume of the later Sixties, which King
      had once thrown at Beetle's head that Beetle might see whence the name
      Gigadibs came. Beetle had quietly annexed the book, and had seen&mdash;several
      things. The quarter-comprehended verses lived and ate with him, as the
      bedropped pages showed. He removed himself from all that world, drifting
      at large with wondrous Men and Women, till McTurk hammered the pilchard
      spoon on his head and he snarled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Beetle! You're oppressed and insulted and bullied by King. Don't you feel
      it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me alone! I can write some more poetry about him if I am, I suppose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mad! Quite mad!&rdquo; said Stalky to the visitors, as one exhibiting strange
      beasts. &ldquo;Beetle reads an ass called Brownin', and McTurk reads an ass
      called Ruskin; and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ruskin isn't an ass,&rdquo; said McTurk. &ldquo;He's almost as good as the Opium
      Eater. He says 'we're children of noble races trained by surrounding art.'
      That means <i>me</i>, and the way I decorated the study when you two
      badgers would have stuck up brackets and Christmas cards. Child of a noble
      race, trained by surrounding art, stop reading, or I'll shove a pilchard
      down your neck!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's two to one,&rdquo; said Stalky, warningly, and Beetle closed the book, in
      obedience to the law under which he and his companions had lived for six
      checkered years.
    </p>
    <p>
      The visitors looked on delighted. Number Five study had a reputation for
      more variegated insanity than the rest of the school put together; and so
      far as its code allowed friendship with outsiders it was polite and
      open-hearted to its neighbors on the same landing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What rot do you want now?&rdquo; said Beetle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;King! War!&rdquo; said McTurk, jerking his head toward the wall, where hung a
      small wooden West-African war-drum, a gift to McTurk from a naval uncle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then we shall be turned out of the study again,&rdquo; said Beetle, who loved
      his flesh-pots. &ldquo;Mason turned us out for&mdash;just warbling on it.&rdquo; Mason
      was the mathematical master who had testified in Common-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Warbling?&mdash;O Lord!&rdquo; said Abanazar. &ldquo;We couldn't hear ourselves speak
      in our study when you played the infernal thing. What's the good of
      getting turned out of your study, anyhow?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We lived in the form-rooms for a week, too,&rdquo; said Beetle, tragically.
      &ldquo;And it was beastly cold.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ye-es, but Mason's rooms were filled with rats every day we were out. It
      took him a week to draw the inference,&rdquo; said McTurk. &ldquo;He loathes rats.
      'Minute he let us go back the rats stopped. Mason's a little shy of us
      now, but there was no evidence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jolly well there wasn't,&rdquo; said Stalky, &ldquo;when I got out on the roof and
      dropped the beastly things down his chimney. But, look here&mdash;question
      is, are our characters good enough just now to stand a study row?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind mine,&rdquo; said Beetle. &ldquo;King swears I haven't any.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm not thinking of you,&rdquo; Stalky returned scornfully. &ldquo;You aren't going
      up for the Army, you old bat. I don't want to be expelled&mdash;and the
      Head's getting rather shy of us, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rot!&rdquo; said McTurk. &ldquo;The Head never expels except for beastliness or
      stealing. But I forgot; you and Stalky <i>are</i> thieves&mdash;regular
      burglars.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The visitors gasped, but Stalky interpreted the parable with large grins.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you know, that little beast Manders minor saw Beetle and me
      hammerin' McTurk's trunk open in the dormitory when we took his watch last
      month. Of course Manders sneaked to Mason, and Mason solemnly took it up
      as a case of theft, to get even with us about the rats.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That just put Mason into our giddy hands,&rdquo; said McTurk, blandly. &ldquo;We were
      nice to him, because he was a new master and wanted to win the confidence
      of the boys. 'Pity he draws inferences, though. Stalky went to his study
      and pretended to blub, and told Mason he'd lead a new life if Mason would
      let him off this time, but Mason wouldn't. 'Said it was his duty to report
      him to the Head.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Vindictive swine!&rdquo; said Beetle. &ldquo;It was all those rats! Then <i>I</i>
      blubbed, too, and Stalky confessed that he'd been a thief in regular
      practice for six years, ever since he came to the school; and that I'd
      taught him&mdash;<i>a la</i> Fagin. Mason turned white with joy. He
      thought he had us on toast.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gorgeous! Gorgeous!&rdquo; said Dick Four. &ldquo;We never heard of this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Course not. Mason kept it jolly quiet. He wrote down all our statements
      on impot-paper. There wasn't anything he wouldn't believe,&rdquo; said Stalky.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And handed it all up to the Head, <i>with</i> an extempore prayer. It
      took about forty pages,&rdquo; said Beetle. &ldquo;I helped him a lot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then, you crazy idiots?&rdquo; said Abanazar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, we were sent for; and Stalky asked to have the 'depositions' read
      out, and the Head knocked him spinning into a waste-paper basket. Then he
      gave us eight cuts apiece&mdash;welters&mdash;for&mdash;for&mdash;takin'
      unheard-of liberties with a new master. I saw his shoulders shaking when
      we went out. Do you know,&rdquo; said Beetle, pensively, &ldquo;that Mason can't look
      at us now in second lesson without blushing? We three stare at him
      sometimes till he regularly trickles. He's an awfully sensitive beast.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He read 'Eric, or Little by Little,'&rdquo; said McTurk; &ldquo;so we gave him 'St.
      Winifred's, or the World of School.' They spent all their spare time
      stealing at St. Winifred's, when they weren't praying or getting drunk at
      pubs. Well, that was only a week ago, and the Head's a little bit shy of
      us. He called it constructive deviltry. Stalky invented it all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not the least good having a row with a master unless you can make an ass
      of him,&rdquo; said Stalky, extended at ease on the hearth-rug. &ldquo;If Mason didn't
      know Number Five&mdash;well, he's learnt, that's all. Now, my dearly
      beloved 'earers&rdquo;&mdash;Stalky curled his legs under him and addressed the
      company&mdash;&ldquo;we've got that strong', perseverin' man King on our hands.
      He went miles out of his way to provoke a conflict.&rdquo; (Here Stalky snapped
      down the black silk domino and assumed the air of a judge.) &ldquo;He has
      oppressed Beetle, McTurk, and me, <i>privatim et seriatim</i>, one by one,
      as he could catch us. But now, he has insulted Number Five up in the
      music-room, and in the presence of these&mdash;these ossifers of the
      Ninety-third, wot look like hairdressers. Binjimin, we must make him cry
      'Capivi!'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Stalky's reading did not include Browning or Ruskin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And, besides,&rdquo; said McTurk, &ldquo;he's a Philistine, a basket-hanger. He wears
      a tartan tie. Ruskin says that any man who wears a tartan tie will,
      without doubt, be damned everlastingly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bravo, McTurk,&rdquo; said Tertius; &ldquo;I thought he was only a beast.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's that, too, of course, but he's worse. He has a china basket with
      blue ribbons and a pink kitten on it, hung up in his window to grow musk
      in. You know when I got all that old oak carvin' out of Bideford Church,
      when they were restoring it (Ruskin says that any man who'll restore a
      church is an unmitigated sweep), and stuck it up here with glue? Well,
      King came in and wanted to know whether we'd done it with a fret-saw! Yah!
      He is the King of basket-hangers!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Down went McTurk's inky thumb over an imaginary arena full of bleeding
      Kings. &ldquo;<i>Placete</i>, child of a generous race!&rdquo; he cried to Beetle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; began Beetle, doubtfully, &ldquo;he comes from Balliol, but I'm going to
      give the beast a chance. You see I can always make him hop with some more
      poetry. He can't report me to the Head, because it makes him ridiculous.
      (Stalky's quite right.) But he shall have his chance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Beetle opened the book on the table, ran his finger down a page, and began
      at random:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   &ldquo;Or who in Moscow toward the Czar
   With the demurest of footfalls,
   Over the Kremlin's pavement white
   With serpentine and syenite,
   Steps with five other generals&mdash;&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's no good. Try another,&rdquo; said Stalky.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hold on a shake; I know what's coming.&rdquo; McTurk was reading over Beetle's
      shoulder.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   &ldquo;That simultaneously take snuff,
   For each to have pretext enough
   And kerchiefwise unfold his sash,
   Which&mdash;softness' self&mdash;is yet the stuff
</pre>
    <p>
      (Gummy! What a sentence!)
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   To hold fast where a steel chain snaps
   And leave the grand white neck no gash.
</pre>
    <p>
      (Full stop.)&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Don't understand a word of it,&rdquo; said Stalky.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;More fool you! Construe,&rdquo; said McTurk. &ldquo;Those six bargees scragged the
      Czar, and left no evidence. <i>Actum est</i> with King.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He gave me that book, too,&rdquo; said Beetle, licking his lips:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   &ldquo;There's a great text in Galatians,
   Once you trip on it entails
   Twenty-nine distinct damnations,
   One sure if another fails.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Then irrelevantly:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   &ldquo;Setebos! Setebos! and Setebos!
   Thinketh he liveth in the cold of the moon.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's just come in from dinner,&rdquo; said Dick Four, looking through the
      window. &ldquo;Manders minor is with him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Safest place for Manders minor just now,&rdquo; said Beetle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you chaps had better clear out,&rdquo; said Stalky politely to the
      visitors. &ldquo;'Tisn't fair to mix you up in a study row. Besides, we can't
      afford to have evidence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you going to begin at once?' said Aladdin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Immediately, if not sooner,&rdquo; said Stalky, and turned out the gas.
      &ldquo;Strong, perseverin' man&mdash;King. Make him cry 'Capivi.' G'way,
      Binjimin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The company retreated to their own neat and spacious study with expectant
      souls.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When Stalky blows out his nostrils like a horse,&rdquo; said Aladdin to the
      Emperor of China, &ldquo;he's on the war-path. 'Wonder what King will get.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Beans,&rdquo; said the Emperor. &ldquo;Number Five generally pays in full.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wonder if I ought to take any notice of it officially,&rdquo; said Abanazar,
      who had just remembered he was a prefect.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's none of your business, Pussy. Besides, if you did, we'd have them
      hostile to us; and we shouldn't be able to do any work,&rdquo; said Aladdin.
      &ldquo;They've begun already.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Now that West-African war-drum had been made to signal across estuaries
      and deltas. Number Five was forbidden to wake the engine within earshot of
      the school. But a deep, devastating drone filled the passages as McTurk
      and Beetle scientifically rubbed its top. Anon it changed to the blare of
      trumpets&mdash;of savage pursuing trumpets. Then, as McTurk slapped one
      side, smooth with the blood of ancient sacrifice, the roar broke into
      short coughing howls such as the wounded gorilla throws in his native
      forest. These were followed by the wrath of King&mdash;three steps at a
      time, up the staircase, with a dry whir of the gown. Aladdin and company,
      listening, squeaked with excitement as the door crashed open. King
      stumbled into the darkness, and cursed those performers by the gods of
      Balliol and quiet repose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Turned out for a week,&rdquo; said Aladdin, holding the study door on the
      crack. &ldquo;Key to be brought down to his study in five minutes. 'Brutes!
      Barbarians! Savages! Children!' He's rather agitated. 'Arrah, Patsy, mind
      the baby,'&rdquo; he sang in a whisper as he clung to the door-knob, dancing a
      noiseless war-dance.
    </p>
    <p>
      King went down-stairs again, and Beetle and McTurk lit the gas to confer
      with Stalky. But Stalky had vanished.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Looks like no end of a mess,&rdquo; said Beetle, collecting his books and
      mathematical instrument case. &ldquo;A week in the form-rooms isn't any
      advantage to us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but don't you see that Stalky isn't here, you owl!&rdquo; said McTurk.
      &ldquo;Take down the key, and look sorrowful. King'll only jaw you for half an
      hour. I'm going to read in the lower form-room.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it's always me,&rdquo; mourned Beetle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait till we see,&rdquo; said McTurk, hopefully. &ldquo;I don't know any more than
      you do what Stalky means, but it's something. Go down and draw King's
      fire. You're used to it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      No sooner had the key turned in the door than the lid of the coal-box,
      which was also the window-seat, lifted cautiously. It had been a tight
      fit, even for the lithe Stalky, his head between his knees, and his
      stomach under his right ear. From a drawer in the table he took a
      well-worn catapult, a handful of buckshot, and a duplicate key of the
      study; noiselessly he raised the window and kneeled by it, his face turned
      to the road, the wind-sloped trees, the dark levels of the Burrows, and
      the white line of breakers falling nine-deep along the Pebbleridge. Far
      down the steep-banked Devonshire lane he heard the husky hoot of the
      carrier's horn. There was a ghost of melody in it, as it might have been
      the wind in a gin-bottle essaying to sing, &ldquo;It's a way we have in the
      Army.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Stalky smiled a tight-lipped smile, and at extreme range opened fire: the
      old horse half wheeled in the shafts.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where he gwaine tu?&rdquo; hiccoughed Rabbits-Eggs. Another buckshot tore
      through the rotten canvas tilt with a vicious zipp.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Habet</i>!&rdquo; murmured Stalky, as Rabbits-Eggs swore into the patient
      night, protesting that he saw the &ldquo;dommed colleger&rdquo; who was assaulting
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so,&rdquo; King was saying in a high head voice to Beetle, whom he had kept
      to play with before Manders minor, well knowing that it hurts a Fifth-form
      boy to be held up to a fag's derision, &ldquo;and so, Master Beetle, in spite of
      all our verses, which we are so proud of, when we presume to come into
      direct conflict with even so humble a representative of authority as
      myself, for instance, we are turned out of our studies, are we not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; said Beetle, with a sheepish grin on his lips and murder in
      his heart. Hope had nearly left him, but he clung to a well-established
      faith that never was Stalky so dangerous as when he was invisible.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are <i>not</i> required to criticise, thank you. Turned out of our
      studies, we are, just as if we were no better than little Manders minor.
      Only inky schoolboys we are, and must be treated as such.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Beetle pricked up his ears, for Rabbits-Eggs was swearing savagely on the
      road, and some of the language entered at the upper sash. King believed in
      ventilation. He strode to the window gowned and majestic, very visible in
      the gaslight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I zee 'un! I zee 'un!&rdquo; roared Rabbits-Eggs, now that he had found a
      visible foe&mdash;another shot from the darkness above. &ldquo;Yiss, yeou, yeou
      long-nosed, fower-eyed, gingy-whiskered beggar! Yeu'm tu old for such
      goin's on. Aie! Poultice yeour nose, I tall 'ee! Poultice yeour long
      nose!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Beetle's heart leaped up within him. Somewhere, somehow, he knew, Stalky
      moved behind these manifestations. There were hope and the prospect of
      revenge. He would embody the suggestion about the nose in deathless verse.
      King threw up the window, and sternly rebuked Rabbits-Eggs. But the
      carrier was beyond fear or fawning. He had descended from the cart, and
      was stooping by the roadside.
    </p>
    <p>
      It all fell swiftly as a dream. Manders minor raised his hand to his head
      with a cry, as a jagged flint cannoned on to some rich tree-calf bindings
      in the book-shelf. Another quoited along the writing-table. Beetle made
      zealous feint to stop it, and in that endeavor overturned a student's
      lamp, which dripped, <i>via</i> King's papers and some choice books,
      greasily on to a Persian rug. There was much broken glass on the
      window-seat; the china basket&mdash;McTurk's aversion&mdash;cracked to
      flinders, had dropped her musk plant and its earth over the red rep
      cushions; Manders minor was bleeding profusely from a cut on the
      cheek-bone; and King, using strange words, every one of which Beetle
      treasured, ran forth to find the school-sergeant, that Rabbits-Eggs might
      be instantly cast into jail.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor chap!&rdquo; said Beetle, with a false, feigned sympathy. &ldquo;Let it bleed a
      little. That'll prevent apoplexy,&rdquo; and he held the blind head skilfully
      over the table, and the papers on the table, as he guided the howling
      Manders to the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then did Beetle, alone with the wreckage, return good for evil. How, in
      that office, a complete set of &ldquo;Gibbon&rdquo; was scarred all along the back as
      by a flint; how so much black and copying ink came to be mingled with
      Manders's gore on the table-cloth; why the big gum-bottle, unstoppered,
      had rolled semicircularly across the floor; and in what manner the white
      china door-knob grew to be painted with yet more of Manders's young blood,
      were matters which Beetle did not explain when the rabid King returned to
      find him standing politely over the reeking hearth-rug.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You never told me to go, sir,&rdquo; he said, with the air of Casabianca, and
      King consigned him to the outer darkness.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it was to a boot-cupboard under the staircase on the ground floor that
      he hastened, to loose the mirth that was destroying him. He had not drawn
      breath for a first whoop of triumph when two hands choked him dumb.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go to the dormitory and get me my things. Bring 'em to Number Five
      lavatory. I'm still in tights,&rdquo; hissed Stalky, sitting on his head. &ldquo;Don't
      run. Walk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Beetle staggered into the form-room next door, and delegated his duty
      to the yet unenlightened McTurk, with an hysterical precis of the campaign
      thus far. So it was McTurk, of the wooden visage, who brought the clothes
      from the dormitory while Beetle panted on a form. Then the three buried
      themselves in Number Five lavatory, turned on all the taps, filled the
      place with steam, and dropped weeping into the baths, where they pieced
      out the war.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Moi</i>! <i>Je</i>! <i>Ich</i>! <i>Ego</i>!&rdquo; gasped Stalky. &ldquo;I waited
      till I couldn't hear myself think, while you played the drum! Hid in the
      coal-locker&mdash;and tweaked Rabbits-Eggs&mdash;and Rabbits-Eggs rocked
      King. Wasn't it beautiful? Did you hear the glass?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, he&mdash;he&mdash;he,&rdquo; shrieked McTurk, one trembling finger pointed
      at Beetle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, I&mdash;I&mdash;I was through it all,&rdquo; Beetle howled; &ldquo;in his study,
      being jawed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, my soul!&rdquo; said Stalky with a yell, disappearing under water.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The&mdash;the glass was nothing. Manders minor's head's cut open. La&mdash;la&mdash;lamp
      upset all over the rug. Blood on the books and papers. The gum! The gum!
      The gum! The ink! The ink! The ink! Oh, Lord!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then Stalky leaped out, all pink as he was, and shook Beetle into some
      sort of coherence; but his tale prostrated them afresh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I bunked for the boot-cupboard the second I heard King go down-stairs.
      Beetle tumbled in on top of me. The spare key's hid behind the loose
      board. There isn't a shadow of evidence,&rdquo; said Stalky. They were all
      chanting together.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And he turned us out himself&mdash;himself&mdash;himself!&rdquo; This from
      McTurk. &ldquo;He can't begin to suspect us. Oh, Stalky, it's the loveliest
      thing we've ever done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gum! Gum! Dollops of gum!&rdquo; shouted Beetle, his spectacles gleaming
      through a sea of lather. &ldquo;Ink and blood all mixed. I held the little
      beast's head all over the Latin proses for Monday. Golly, how the oil
      stunk! And Rabbits-Eggs told King to poultice his nose! Did you hit
      Rabbits-Eggs, Stalky?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did I jolly well not? Tweaked him all over. Did you hear him curse? Oh, I
      shall be sick in a minute if I don't stop.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But dressing was a slow process, because McTurk was obliged to dance when
      he heard that the musk basket was broken, and, moreover, Beetle retailed
      all King's language with emendations and purple insets.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shockin'!&rdquo; said Stalky, collapsing in a helpless welter of half-hitched
      trousers. &ldquo;So dam' bad, too, for innocent boys like us! Wonder what they'd
      say at 'St. Winifred's, or the World of School.'&mdash;By gum! That
      reminds me we owe the Lower Third one for assaultin' Beetle when he
      chivied Manders minor. Come on! It's an alibi, Samivel; and, besides, if
      we let 'em off they'll be worse next time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Lower Third had set a guard upon their form-room for the space of a
      full hour, which to a boy is a lifetime. Now they were busy with their
      Saturday evening businesses&mdash;cooking sparrows over the gas with rusty
      nibs; brewing unholy drinks in gallipots; skinning moles with
      pocket-knives; attending to paper trays full of silkworms, or discussing
      the iniquities of their elders with a freedom, fluency, and point that
      would have amazed their parents. The blow fell without warning. Stalky
      upset a form crowded with small boys among their own cooking utensils,
      McTurk raided the untidy lockers as a terrier digs at a rabbit-hole, while
      Beetle poured ink upon such heads as he could not appeal to with a Smith's
      Classical Dictionary. Three brisk minutes accounted for many silkworms,
      pet larvae, French exercises, school caps, half-prepared bones and skulls,
      and a dozen pots of home-made sloe jam. It was a great wreckage, and the
      form-room looked as though three conflicting tempests had smitten it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Phew!&rdquo; said Stalky, drawing breath outside the door (amid groans of &ldquo;Oh,
      you beastly ca-ads! You think yourselves awful funny,&rdquo; and so forth). &ldquo;<i>That's</i>
      all right. Never let the sun go down upon your wrath. Rummy little devils,
      fags. Got no notion o' combinin'.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Six of 'em sat on my head when I went in after Manders minor,&rdquo; said
      Beetle. &ldquo;I warned 'em what they'd get, though.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Everybody paid in full&mdash;beautiful feelin',&rdquo; said McTurk absently, as
      they strolled along the corridor. &ldquo;Don't think we'd better say much about
      King, though, do you, Stalky?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not <i>much</i>. Our line is injured innocence, of course&mdash;same as
      when the Sergeant reported us on suspicion of smoking in the bunkers. If I
      hadn't thought of buyin' the pepper and spillin' it all over our clothes,
      he'd have smelt us. King was gha-astly facetious about that. 'Called us
      bird-stuffers in form for a week.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, King hates the Natural History Society because little Hartopp is
      president. Mustn't do anything in the Coll. without glorifyin' King,&rdquo; said
      McTurk. &ldquo;But he must be a putrid ass, know, to suppose at our time o' life
      we'd go and stuff birds like fags.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor old King!&rdquo; said Beetle. &ldquo;He's unpopular in Common-room, and they'll
      chaff his head off about Rabbits-Eggs. Golly! How lovely! How beautiful!
      How holy! But you should have seen his face when the first rock came in!
      <i>And</i> the earth from the basket!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So they were all stricken helpless for five minutes.
    </p>
    <p>
      They repaired at last to Abanazar's study, and were received reverently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's the matter?&rdquo; said Stalky, quick to realize new atmospheres.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know jolly well,&rdquo; said Abanazar. &ldquo;You'll be expelled if you get
      caught. King is a gibbering maniac.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who? Which? What? Expelled for how? We only played the war-drum. We've
      got turned out for that already.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you chaps mean to say you didn't make Rabbits-Eggs drunk and bribe him
      to rock King's rooms?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bribe him? No, that I'll swear we didn't,&rdquo; said Stalky, with a relieved
      heart, for he loved not to tell lies. &ldquo;What a low mind you've got, Pussy!
      We've been down having a bath. Did Rabbits-Eggs rock King? Strong,
      perseverin' man King? Shockin'!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Awf'ly. King's frothing at the mouth. There's bell for prayers. Come on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait a sec,&rdquo; said Stalky, continuing the conversation in a loud and
      cheerful voice, as they descended the stairs. &ldquo;What did Rabbits-Eggs rock
      King for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know,&rdquo; said Beetle, as they passed King's open door. &ldquo;I was in his
      study.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush, you ass!&rdquo; hissed the Emperor of China. &ldquo;Oh, he's gone down to
      prayers,&rdquo; said Beetle, watching the shadow of the house-master on the
      wall. &ldquo;Rabbits-Eggs was only a bit drunk, swearin' at his horse, and King
      jawed him through the window, and then, of course, he rocked King.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean to say,&rdquo; said Stalky, &ldquo;that King began it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      King was behind them, and every well-weighed word went up the staircase
      like an arrow. &ldquo;I can only swear,&rdquo; said Beetle, &ldquo;that King cursed like a
      bargee. Simply disgustin'. I'm goin' to write to my father about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Better report it to Mason,&rdquo; suggested Stalky. &ldquo;He knows our tender
      consciences. Hold on a shake. I've got to tie my boot-lace.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The other study hurried forward. They did not wish to be dragged into
      stage asides of this nature. So it was left to McTurk to sum up the
      situation beneath the guns of the enemy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see,&rdquo; said the Irishman, hanging on the banister, &ldquo;he begins by
      bullying little chaps; then he bullies the big chaps; then he bullies some
      one who isn't connected with the College, and then catches it. Serves him
      jolly well right... I beg your pardon, sir. I didn't see you were coming
      down the staircase.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The black gown tore past like a thunder-storm, and in its wake, three
      abreast, arms linked, the Aladdin company rolled up the big corridor to
      prayers, singing with most innocent intention:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   &ldquo;Arrah, Patsy, mind the baby! Arrah, Patsy, mind the child!
   Wrap him up in an overcoat, he's surely goin' wild!
   Arrah, Patsy, mind the baby; just ye mind the child awhile!
   He'll kick an' bite an' cry all night! Arrah, Patsy, mind
     the child!&rdquo;
 </pre>

    <h2>
      AN UNSAVORY INTERLUDE.
    </h2>
    <p>
      It was a maiden aunt of Stalky who sent him both books, with the
      inscription, &ldquo;To dearest Artie, on his sixteenth birthday;&rdquo; it was McTurk
      who ordered their hypothecation; and it was Beetle, returned from
      Bideford, who flung them on the window-sill of Number Five study with news
      that Bastable would advance but ninepence on the two; &ldquo;Eric; or, Little by
      Little,&rdquo; being almost as great a drug as &ldquo;St. Winifred's.&rdquo; &ldquo;An' I don't
      think much of your aunt. We're nearly out of cartridges, too&mdash;Artie,
      dear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Whereupon Stalky rose up to grapple with him, but McTurk sat on Stalky's
      head, calling him a &ldquo;pure-minded boy&rdquo; till peace was declared. As they
      were grievously in arrears with a Latin prose, as it was a blazing July
      afternoon, and as they ought to have been at a house cricket-match, they
      began to renew their acquaintance, intimate and unholy, with the volumes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here we are!&rdquo; said McTurk. &ldquo;'Corporal punishment produced on Eric the
      worst effects. He burned <i>not</i> with remorse or regret'&mdash;make a
      note o' that, Beetle&mdash;' but with shame and violent indignation. He
      glared'&mdash;oh, naughty Eric! Let's get to where he goes in for drink.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hold on half a shake. Here's another sample. 'The Sixth,' he says, 'is the
      palladium of all public schools.' But this lot&mdash;&rdquo; Stalky rapped the
      gilded book&mdash;&ldquo;can't prevent fellows drinkin' and stealin', an'
      lettin' fags out of window at night, an'&mdash;an' doin' what they please.
      Golly, what we've missed&mdash;not goin' to St. Winifred's!...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm sorry to see any boys of my house taking so little interest in their
      matches.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Prout could move very silently if he pleased, though that is no merit
      in a boy's eyes. He had flung open the study-door without knocking&mdash;another
      sin&mdash;and looked at them suspiciously. &ldquo;Very sorry, indeed, I am to
      see you frowsting in your studies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We've been out ever since dinner, sir,&rdquo; said. McTurk wearily. One
      house-match is just like another, and their &ldquo;ploy&rdquo; of that week happened
      to be rabbit-shooting with saloon-pistols.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can't see a ball when it's coming, sir,&rdquo; said Beetle. &ldquo;I've had my
      gig-lamps smashed at the Nets till I got excused. I wasn't any good even
      as a fag, then, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tuck is probably your form. Tuck and brewing. Why can't you three take
      any interest in the honor of your house?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They had heard that phrase till they were wearied. The &ldquo;honor of the
      house&rdquo; was Prout's weak point, and they knew well how to flick him on the
      raw.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you order us to go down, sir, of course we'll go,&rdquo; said Stalky, with
      maddening politeness. But Prout knew better than that. He had tried the
      experiment once at a big match, when the three, self-isolated, stood to
      attention for half an hour in full view of all the visitors, to whom fags,
      subsidized for that end, pointed them out as victims of Prout's tyranny.
      And Prout was a sensitive man.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the infinitely petty confederacies of the Common-room, King and Macrea,
      fellow house-masters, had borne it in upon him that by games, and games
      alone, was salvation wrought. Boys neglected were boys lost. They must be
      disciplined. Left to himself, Prout would have made a sympathetic
      house-master; but he was never so left, and with the devilish insight of
      youth, the boys knew to whom they were indebted for his zeal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Must we go down, sir?' said McTurk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't want to order you to do what a right-thinking boy should do
      gladly. I'm sorry.&rdquo; And he lurched out with some hazy impression that he
      had sown good seed on poor ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now what does he suppose is the use of that?&rdquo; said Beetle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, he's cracked. King jaws him in Common-room about not keepin' us up to
      the mark, an' Macrea burbles about 'dithcipline,' an' old Heffy sits
      between 'em sweatin' big drops. I heard Oke (the Common-room butler)
      talking to Richards (Prout's house-servant) about it down in the basement
      the other day when I went down to bag some bread,&rdquo; said Stalky.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did Oke say?&rdquo; demanded McTurk, throwing &ldquo;Eric&rdquo; into a corner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, he said, 'They make more nise nor a nest full o' jackdaws, an' half
      of it like we'd no ears to our heads that waited on 'em. They talks over
      old Prout&mdash;what he've done an' left undone about his boys. An' how
      their boys be fine boys, an' his'n be dom bad.' Well, Oke talked like
      that, you know, and Richards got awf'ly wrathy. He has a down on King for
      something or other. Wonder why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, King talks about Prout in form-room&mdash;makes allusions, an' all
      that&mdash;only half the chaps are such asses they can't see what he's
      drivin' at. And d'you remember what he said about the 'Casual House' last
      Tuesday? He meant us. They say he says perfectly beastly things to his own
      house, making fun of Prout's,&rdquo; said Beetle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, we didn't come here to mix up in their rows,&rdquo; McTurk said
      wrathfully. &ldquo;Who'll bathe after call-over? King's takin' it in the
      cricket-field. Come on.&rdquo; Turkey seized his straw and led the way.
    </p>
    <p>
      They reached the sun-blistered pavilion over against the gray Pebbleridge
      just before roll-call, and, asking no questions, gathered from King's
      voice and manner that his house was on the road to victory.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, ha!&rdquo; said he, turning to show the light of his countenance. &ldquo;Here we
      have the ornaments of the Casual House at last. You consider cricket
      beneath you, I believe &ldquo;&mdash;the crowd, flannelled, sniggered &ldquo;and from
      what I have seen this afternoon, I fancy many others of your house hold
      the same view. And may I ask what you purpose to do with your noble selves
      till tea-time?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Going down to bathe, sir,&rdquo; said Stalky.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And whence this sudden zeal for cleanliness? There is nothing about you
      that particularly suggests it. Indeed, so far as I remember&mdash;I may be
      at fault&mdash;but a short time ago&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Five years, sir,&rdquo; said Beetle hotly.
    </p>
    <p>
      King scowled. &ldquo;<i>One</i> of you was that thing called a water-funk. Yes,
      a water-funk. So now you wish to wash? It is well. Cleanliness never
      injured a boy or&mdash;a house. We will proceed to business,&rdquo; and he
      addressed himself to the call-over board.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What the deuce did you say anything to him for, Beetle?&rdquo; said McTurk
      angrily, as they strolled towards the big, open sea-baths.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Twasn't fair&mdash;remindin' one of bein' a water-funk. My first term,
      too. Heaps of chaps are&mdash;when they can't swim.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, you ass; but he saw he'd fetched you. You ought never to answer
      King.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it wasn't fair, Stalky.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My Hat! You've been here six years, and you expect fairness. Well, you
      are a dithering idiot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A knot of King's boys, also bound for the baths, hailed them, beseeching
      them to wash&mdash;for the honor of their house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's what comes of King's jawin' and messin'. Those young animals
      wouldn't have thought of it unless he'd put it into their heads. Now
      they'll be funny about it for weeks,&rdquo; said Stalky. &ldquo;Don't take any
      notice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The boys came nearer, shouting an opprobrious word. At last they moved to
      windward, ostentatiously holding their noses.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's pretty,&rdquo; said Beetle. &ldquo;They'll be sayin' our house stinks next.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When they returned from the baths, damp-headed, languid, at peace with the
      world, Beetle's forecast came only too true. They were met in the corridor
      by a fag&mdash;a common, Lower-Second fag&mdash;who at arm's length handed
      them a carefully wrapped piece of soap &ldquo;with the compliments of King's
      House.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hold on,&rdquo; said Stalky, checking immediate attack. &ldquo;Who put you up to
      this, Nixon? Rattray and White? (Those were two leaders in King's house.)
      Thank you. There's no answer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it's too sickening to have this kind o' rot shoved on to a chap.
      What's the sense of it? What's the fun of it?&rdquo; said McTurk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will go on to the end of the term, though,&rdquo; Beetle wagged his head
      sorrowfully. He had worn many jests threadbare on his own account.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a few days it became an established legend of the school that Prout's
      house did not wash and were therefore noisome. Mr. King was pleased to
      smile succulently in form when one of his boys drew aside from Beetle with
      certain gestures.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There seems to be some disability attaching to you, my Beetle, or else
      why should Burton major withdraw, so to speak, the hem of his garments? I
      confess I am still in the dark. Will some one be good enough to enlighten
      me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Naturally, he was enlightened by half the form.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Extraordinary! Most extraordinary! However, each house has its
      traditions, with which I would not for the world interfere. <i>We</i> have
      a prejudice in favor of washing. Go on, Beetle&mdash;from '<i>jugurtha
      tamen</i>'&mdash;and, if you can, avoid the more flagrant forms of
      guessing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Prout's house was furious because Macrea's and Hartopp's houses joined
      King's to insult them. They called a house-meeting after dinner&mdash;an
      excited and angry meeting of all save the prefects, whose dignity, though
      they sympathized, did not allow them to attend. They read ungrammatical
      resolutions, and made speeches beginning, &ldquo;Gentlemen, we have met on this
      occasion,&rdquo; and ending with, &ldquo;It's a beastly shame,&rdquo; precisely as houses
      have done since time and schools began.
    </p>
    <p>
      Number Five study attended, with its usual air of bland patronage. At last
      McTurk, of the lanthorn jaws, delivered himself:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You jabber and jaw and burble, and that's about all you can do. What's
      the good of it? King's house'll only gloat because they've drawn you, and
      King will gloat, too. Besides, that resolution of Orrin's is chock-full of
      bad grammar, and King'll gloat over that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought you an' Beetle would put it right, an'&mdash;an' we'd post it
      in the corridor,&rdquo; said the composer meekly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Par si je le connai</i>. I'm not goin' to meddle with the biznai,&rdquo;
       said Beetle. &ldquo;It's a gloat for King's house. Turkey's quite right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, won't Stalky, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Stalky puffed out his cheeks and squinted down his nose in the style
      of Panurge, and all he said was, &ldquo;Oh, you abject burblers!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're three beastly scabs!&rdquo; was the instant retort of the democracy, and
      they went out amid execrations.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is piffling,&rdquo; said McTurk. &ldquo;Let's get our sallies, and go and shoot
      bunnies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Three saloon-pistols, with a supply of bulleted breech-caps, were stored
      in Stalky's trunk, and this trunk was in their dormitory, and their
      dormitory was a three-bed attic one, opening out of a ten-bed
      establishment, which, in turn, communicated with the great range of
      dormitories that ran practically from one end of the College to the other.
      Macrea's house lay next to Prout's, King's next to Macrea's, and Hartopp's
      beyond that again. Carefully locked doors divided house from house, but
      each house, in its internal arrangements&mdash;the College had originally
      been a terrace of twelve large houses&mdash;was a replica of the next; one
      straight roof covering all.
    </p>
    <p>
      They found Stalky's bed drawn out from the wall to the left of the dormer
      window, and the latter end of Richards protruding from a two-foot-square
      cupboard in the wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's all this? I've never noticed it before. What are you tryin' to do,
      Fatty?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fillin' basins, Muster Corkran.&rdquo; Richards's voice was hollow and muffled.
      &ldquo;They've been savin' me trouble. Yiss.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Looks like it,&rdquo; said McTurk. &ldquo;Hi! You'll stick if you don't take care.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Richards backed puffing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can't rache un. Yiss, 'tess a turncock, Muster McTurk. They've took an'
      runned all the watter-pipes a storey higher in the houses&mdash;runned 'em
      all along under the 'ang of the heaves, like. Runned 'em in last holidays.
      <i>I</i> can't rache the turncock.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me try,&rdquo; said Stalky, diving into the aperture.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Slip 'ee to the left, then, Muster Corkran. Slip 'ee to the left, an'
      feel in the dark.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To the left Stalky wriggled, and saw a long line of lead pipe disappearing
      up a triangular tunnel, whose roof was the rafters and boarding of the
      college roof, whose floor was sharp-edged joists, and whose side was the
      rough studding of the lath and plaster wall under the dormer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rummy show. How far does it go?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Right along, Muster Corkran&mdash;right along from end to end. Her runs
      under the 'ang of the heaves. Have 'ee rached the stopcock yet? Mr. King
      got un put in to save us carryin' watter from down-stairs to fill the
      basins. No place for a lusty man like old Richards. I'm tu thickabout to
      go ferritin'. Thank 'ee, Muster Corkran.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The water squirted through the tap just inside the cupboard, and, having
      filled the basins, the grateful Richards waddled away.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boys sat round-eyed on their beds considering the possibilities of
      this trove. Two floors below them they could hear the hum of the angry
      house; for nothing is so still as a dormitory in mid-afternoon of a
      midsummer term.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It has been papered over till now.&rdquo; McTurk examined the little door. &ldquo;If
      we'd only known before!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I vote we go down and explore. No one will come up this time o' day. We
      needn't keep <i>cave''</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They crawled in, Stalky leading, drew the door behind them, and on all
      fours embarked on a dark and dirty road full of plaster, odd shavings, and
      all the raffle that builders leave in the waste room of a house. The
      passage was perhaps three feet wide, and, except for the struggling light
      round the edges of the cupboards (there was one to each dormer), almost
      pitchy dark.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here's Macrea's house,&rdquo; said Stalky, his eye at the crack of the third
      cupboard. &ldquo;I can see Barnes's name on his trunk. Don't make such a row,
      Beetle! We can get right to the end of the Coll. Come on!... We're in
      King's house now&mdash;I can see a bit of Rattray's trunk. How these
      beastly boards hurt one's knees!&rdquo; They heard his nails scraping, on
      plaster.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's the ceiling below. Look out! If we smashed that the plaster 'ud
      fall down in the lower dormitory,&rdquo; said Beetle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let's,&rdquo; whispered McTurk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An' be collared first thing? Not much. Why, I can shove my hand ever so
      far up between these boards.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Stalky thrust an arm to the elbow between the joists.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No good stayin' here. I vote we go back and talk it over. It's a crummy
      place. 'Must say I'm grateful to King for his water-works.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They crawled out, brushed one another clean, slid the saloon-pistols down
      a trouser-leg, and hurried forth to a deep and solitary Devonshire lane in
      whose flanks a boy might sometimes slay a young rabbit. They threw
      themselves down under the rank elder bushes, and began to think aloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know,&rdquo; said Stalky at last, sighting at a distant sparrow, &ldquo;we could
      hide our sallies in there like anything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Huh!&rdquo; Beetle snorted, choked, and gurgled. He had been silent since they
      left the dormitory. &ldquo;Did you ever read a book called 'The History of a
      House' or something? I got it out of the library the other day. A French
      woman wrote it&mdash;Violet somebody. But it's translated, you know; and
      it's very interestin'. Tells you how a house is built.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, if you're in a sweat to find out that, you can go down to the new
      cottages they're building for the coastguard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My Hat! I will.&rdquo; He felt in his pockets. &ldquo;Give me tuppence, some one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rot! Stay here, and don't mess about in the sun.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gi' me tuppence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say, Beetle, you aren't stuffy about anything, are you?&rdquo; said McTurk,
      handing over the coppers. His tone was serious, for though Stalky often,
      and McTurk occasionally, manoeuvred on his own account, Beetle had never
      been known to do so in all the history of the confederacy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I'm not. I'm thinking.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, we'll come, too,&rdquo; said Stalky, with a general's suspicion of his
      aides.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't want you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, leave him alone. He's been taken worse with a poem,&rdquo; said McTurk.
      &ldquo;He'll go burbling down to the Pebbleridge and spit it all up in the study
      when he comes back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then why did he want the tuppence, Turkey? He's gettin' too beastly
      independent. Hi! There's a bunny. No, it ain't. It's a cat, by Jove! You
      plug first.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Twenty minutes later a boy with a straw hat at the back of his head, and
      his hands in his pockets, was staring at workmen as they moved about a
      half-finished cottage. He produced some ferocious tobacco, and was passed
      from the forecourt into the interior, where he asked many questions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, let's have your beastly epic,&rdquo; said Turkey, as they burst into the
      study, to find Beetle deep in Viollet-le-Duc and some drawings. &ldquo;We've had
      no end of a lark.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Epic? What epic? I've been down to the coastguard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No epic? Then we will slay you, O Beetle,&rdquo; said Stalky, moving to the
      attack. &ldquo;You've got something up your sleeve. <i>I</i> know, when you talk
      in that tone!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your Uncle Beetle&rdquo;&mdash;with an attempt to imitate Stalky's war-voice&mdash;&ldquo;is
      a great man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no; he jolly well isn't anything of the kind. You deceive yourself,
      Beetle. Scrag him, Turkey!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A great man,&rdquo; Beetle gurgled from the floor. &ldquo;<i>You</i> are futile&mdash;look
      out for my tie!&mdash;futile burblers. I am the Great Man. I gloat. Ouch!
      Hear me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Beetle, de-ah&rdquo;&mdash;Stalky dropped unreservedly on Beetle's chest&mdash;&ldquo;we
      love you, an' you're a poet. If I ever said you were a doggaroo, I
      apologize; but you know as well as we do that you can't do anything by
      yourself without mucking it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've got a notion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you'll spoil the whole show if you don't tell your Uncle Stalky.
      Cough it up, ducky, and we'll see what we can do. Notion, you fat impostor&mdash;I
      knew you had a notion when you went away! Turkey said it was a poem.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've found out how houses are built. Le' me get up. The floor-joists of
      one room are the ceiling-joists of the room below.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't be so filthy technical.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, the man told me. The floor is laid on top of those joists&mdash;those
      boards on edge that we crawled over&mdash;but the floor stops at a
      partition. Well, if you get behind a partition, same as you did in the
      attic, don't you see that you can shove anything you please under the
      floor between the floor-boards and the lath and plaster of the ceiling
      below? Look here. I've drawn it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He produced a rude sketch, sufficient to enlighten the allies. There is no
      part of the modern school curriculum that deals with architecture, and
      none of them had yet reflected whether floors and ceilings were hollow or
      solid. Outside his own immediate interests the boy is as ignorant as the
      savage he so admires; but he has also the savage's resource.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see,&rdquo; said Stalky. &ldquo;I shoved my hand there. An' then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An' then They've been calling us stinkers, you know. We might shove
      somethin' under&mdash;sulphur, or something that stunk pretty bad&mdash;an'
      stink 'em out. I know it can be done somehow.&rdquo; Beetle's eyes turned to
      Stalky handling the diagrams.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stinks?&rdquo; said Stalky interrogatively. Then his face grew luminous with
      delight. &ldquo;By gum! I've got it. Horrid stinks! Turkey!&rdquo; He leaped at the
      Irishman. &ldquo;This afternoon&mdash;just after Beetle went away! <i>She's</i>
      the very thing!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come to my arms, my beamish boy,&rdquo; caroled McTurk, and they fell into each
      other's arms dancing. &ldquo;Oh, frabjous day! Calloo, callay! She will! She
      will!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hold on,&rdquo; said Beetle. &ldquo;I don't understand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dearr man! It shall, though. Oh, Artie, my pure-souled youth, let us tell
      our darling Reggie about Pestiferous Stinkadores.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not until after call-over. Come on!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say,&rdquo; said Orrin, stiffly, as they fell into their places along the
      walls of the gymnasium. &ldquo;The house are goin' to hold another meeting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hold away, then.&rdquo; Stalky's mind was elsewhere.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's about you three this time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, give 'em my love... <i>Here, sir</i>,&rdquo; and he tore down the
      corridor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gamboling like kids at play, with bounds and sidestarts, with caperings
      and curvetings, they led the almost bursting Beetle to the rabbit-lane,
      and from under a pile of stones drew forth the new-slain corpse of a cat.
      Then did Beetle see the inner meaning of what had gone before, and lifted
      up his voice in thanksgiving for that the world held warriors so wise as
      Stalky and McTurk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well-nourished old lady, ain't she?&rdquo; said Stalky. &ldquo;How long d'you suppose
      it'll take her to get a bit whiff in a confined space?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bit whiff! What a coarse brute you are!&rdquo; said McTurk. &ldquo;Can't a poor
      pussy-cat get under King's dormitory floor to die without your pursuin'
      her with your foul innuendoes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did she die under the floor for?' said Beetle, looking to the
      future.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, they won't worry about that when they find her,&rdquo; said Stalky.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A cat may look at a king.&rdquo; McTurk rolled down the bank at his own jest.
      &ldquo;Pussy, you don't know how useful you're goin' to be to three pure-souled,
      high-minded boys.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They'll have to take up the floor for her, same as they did in Number
      Nine when the rat croaked. Big medicine&mdash;heap big medicine! Phew! Oh,
      Lord, I wish I could stop laughin',&rdquo; said Beetle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stinks! Hi, stinks! Clammy ones!&rdquo; McTurk gasped as he regained his place.
      &ldquo;And&rdquo;&mdash;the exquisite humor of it brought them sliding down together
      in a tangle&mdash;&ldquo;it's all for the honor of the house, too!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An' they're holdin' another meeting&mdash;on us,&rdquo; Stalky panted, his
      knees in the ditch and his face in the long grass. &ldquo;Well, let's get the
      bullet out of her and hurry up. The sooner she's bedded out the better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Between them they did some grisly work with a penknife; between them (ask
      not who buttoned her to his bosom) they took up the corpse and hastened
      back, Stalky arranging their plan of action at the full trot.
    </p>
    <p>
      The afternoon sun, lying in broad patches on the bed-rugs, saw three boys
      and an umbrella disappear into a dormitory wall. In five minutes they
      emerged, brushed themselves all over, washed their hands, combed their
      hair, and descended.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you sure you shoved her far enough under?&rdquo; said McTurk suddenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hang it, man, I shoved her the full length of my arm and Beetle's brolly.
      That must be about six feet. She's bung in the middle of King's big upper
      ten-bedder. Eligible central situation, <i>I</i> call it. She'll stink out
      his chaps, and Hartopp's and Macrea's, when she really begins to fume. I
      swear your Uncle Stalky is a great man. Do you realize what a great man he
      is, Beetle?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I had the notion first, hadn't I&mdash;? only&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You couldn't do it without your Uncle Stalky, could you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They've been calling us stinkers for a week now,&rdquo; said McTurk. &ldquo;Oh, <i>won't</i>
      they catch it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stinker! Yah! Stink-ah!&rdquo; rang down the corridor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And she's there,&rdquo; said Stalky, a hand on either boy's shoulder. &ldquo;She&mdash;is&mdash;there,
      gettin' ready to surprise 'em. Presently she'll begin to whisper to 'em in
      their dreams. Then she'll whiff. Golly, how she'll whiff! Oblige me by
      thinkin' of it for two minutes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They went to their study in more or less of silence. There they began to
      laugh&mdash;laugh as only boys can. They laughed with their foreheads on
      the tables, or on the floor; laughed at length, curled over the backs of
      chairs or clinging to a book-shelf; laughed themselves limp.
    </p>
    <p>
      And in the middle of it Orrin entered on behalf of the house. &ldquo;Don't mind
      us, Orrin; sit down. You don't know how we respect and admire you. There's
      something about your pure, high young forehead, full of the dreams of
      innocent boyhood, that's no end fetchin'. It is, indeed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The house sent me to give you this.&rdquo; He laid a folded sheet of paper on
      the table and retired with an awful front.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's the resolution! Oh, read it, some one. I'm too silly-sick with
      laughin' to see,&rdquo; said Beetle. Stalky jerked it open with a precautionary
      sniff. &ldquo;Phew! Phew! Listen. '<i>The house notices with pain and contempt
      the attitude of indiference</i>' &mdash;how many f's in indifference,
      Beetle?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Two for choice.&rdquo;
     </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Only one here&mdash; adopted by the occupants of Number Five study in
relation to the insults offered to Mr. Prout's house at the recent
meeting in Number Twelve form-room, and the House hereby pass a
vote of censure on the said study. That's all.&rdquo;

&ldquo;And she bled all down my shirt, too!&rdquo; said Beetle.
</p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An' I'm catty all over,&rdquo; said McTurk, &ldquo;though I washed twice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An' I nearly broke Beetle's brolly plantin' her where she would blossom!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The situation was beyond speech, but not laughter. There was some attempt
      that night to demonstrate against the three in their dormitory; so they
      came forth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see,&rdquo; Beetle began suavely as he loosened his braces, &ldquo;the trouble
      with you is that you're a set of unthinkin' asses. You've no more brains
      than spidgers. We've told you that heaps of times, haven't we?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We'll give the three of you a dormitory lickin'. You always jaw at us as
      if you were prefects,&rdquo; cried one.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no, you won't,&rdquo; said Stalky, &ldquo;because you know that if you did you'd
      get the worst of it sooner or later. <i>We</i> aren't in any hurry. We can
      afford to wait for our little revenges. You've made howlin' asses of
      yourselves, and just as soon as King gets hold of your precious
      resolutions to-morrow you'll find that out. If you aren't sick an' sorry
      by to-morrow night, I'll&mdash;I'll eat my hat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But or ever the dinner-bell rang the next day Prout's were sadly aware of
      their error. King received stray members of that house with an exaggerated
      attitude of fear. Did they purpose to cause him to be dismissed from the
      College by unanimous resolution? What were their views concerning the
      government of the school, that he might hasten to give effect to them? he
      would not offend them for worlds; but he feared&mdash;he sadly feared&mdash;that
      his own house, who did not pass resolutions (but washed), might somewhat
      deride.
    </p>
    <p>
      King was a happy man, and his house, basking in the favor of his smile,
      made that afternoon a long penance to the misled Prouts. And Prout
      himself, with a dull and lowering visage, tried to think out the rights
      and wrongs of it all, only plunging deeper into bewilderment. Why should
      his house be called &ldquo;Stinkers&rdquo;? Truly, it was a small thing, but he had
      been trained to believe that straws show which way the wind blows, and
      that there is no smoke without fire. He approached King in Common-room
      with a sense of injustice, but King was pleased to be full of airy
      persiflage that tide, and brilliantly danced dialectical rings round
      Prout.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said Stalky at bedtime, making pilgrimage through the dormitories
      before the prefects came by, &ldquo;<i>now</i> what have you got to say for
      yourselves? Foster, Carton, Finch, Longbridge, Marlin, Brett! I heard you
      chaps catchin' it from King&mdash;he made hay of you&mdash;an' all you
      could do was to wriggle an' grin an' say, 'Yes, sir,' an' 'No, sir,' an'
      'Oh, sir,' an' 'Please, sir'! You an' your resolution! Urh!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, shut up, Stalky.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a bit of it. You're a gaudy lot of resolutionists, you are! You've
      made a sweet mess of it. Perhaps you'll have the decency to leave us alone
      next time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here the house grew angry, and in many voices pointed out how this blunder
      would never have come to pass if Number Five study had helped them from
      the first.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you chaps are so beastly conceited, an'&mdash;an' you swaggered into
      the meetin' as if we were a lot of idiots,&rdquo; growled Orrin of the
      resolution.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's precisely what you are! That's what we've been tryin' to hammer
      into your thick heads all this time,&rdquo; said Stalky. &ldquo;Never mind, we'll
      forgive you. Cheer up. You can't help bein' asses, you know,&rdquo; and, the
      enemy's flank deftly turned, Stalky hopped into bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      That night was the first of sorrow among the jubilant King's. By some
      accident of under-floor drafts the cat did not vex the dormitory beneath
      which she lay, but the next one to the right; stealing on the air rather
      as a pale-blue sensation than as any poignant offense. But the mere
      adumbration of an odor is enough for the sensitive nose and clean tongue
      of youth. Decency demands that we draw several carbolized sheets over what
      the dormitory said to Mr. King and what Mr. King replied. He was genuinely
      proud of his house and fastidious in all that concerned their well-being.
      He came; he sniffed; he said things. Next morning a boy in that dormitory
      confided to his bosom friend, a fag of Macrea's, that there was trouble in
      their midst which King would fain keep secret.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Macrea's boy had also a bosom friend in Prout's, a shock-headed fag of
      malignant disposition, who, when he had wormed out the secret, told&mdash;told
      it in a high-pitched treble that rang along the corridor like a bat's
      squeak.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An'&mdash;an' they've been calling us 'stinkers' all this week. Why,
      Harland minor says they simply can't sleep in his dormitory for the stink.
      Come on!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With one shout and with one cry&rdquo; Prout's juniors hurled themselves into
      the war, and through the interval between first and second lesson some
      fifty twelve-year-olds were embroiled on the gravel outside King's windows
      to a tune whose <i>leit-motif</i> was the word &ldquo;stinker.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hark to the minute-gun at sea!&rdquo; said Stalky. They were in their study
      collecting books for second lesson&mdash;Latin, with King. &ldquo;I thought his
      azure brow was a bit cloudy at prayers. 'She is comin', sister Mary. She
      is&mdash;'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If they make such a row now, what will they do when she really begins to
      look up an' take notice?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, no vulgar repartee, Beetle. All we want is to keep out of this row
      like gentlemen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Tis but a little faded flower.' Where's my Horace? Look here, I don't
      understand what she means by stinkin' out Rattray's dormitory first. We
      holed in under White's, didn't we?&rdquo; asked McTurk, with a wrinkled brow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Skittish little thing. She's rompin' about all over the place, I
      suppose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My Aunt! King'll be a cheerful customer at second lesson. I haven't
      prepared my Horace one little bit, either,&rdquo; said Beetle. &ldquo;Come on!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They were outside the form-room door now. It was within five minutes of
      the bell, and King might arrive at any moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Turkey elbowed into a cohort of scuffling fags, cut out Thornton tertius
      (he that had been Harland's bosom friend), and bade him tell his tale.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a simple one, interrupted by tears. Many of King's house had
      already battered him for libel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it's nothing,&rdquo; McTurk cried. &ldquo;He says that King's house stinks.
      That's all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stale!&rdquo; Stalky shouted. &ldquo;We knew that years ago, only we didn't choose to
      run about shoutin' 'stinker.' We've got some manners, ir they haven't.
      Catch a fag, Turkey, and make sure of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Turkey's long arm closed on a hurried and anxious ornament of the Lower
      Second.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, McTurk, please let me go. I don't stink&mdash;I swear I don't!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Guilty conscience!&rdquo; cried Beetle. &ldquo;Who said you did?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What d'you make of it?&rdquo; Stalky punted the small boy into Beetle's arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Snf! Snf! He does, though. I think it's leprosy&mdash;or thrush. P'raps
      it's both. Take it away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed, Master Beetle&rdquo;&mdash;King generally came to the house-door for a
      minute or two as the bell rang&mdash;&ldquo;we are vastly indebted to you for
      your diagnosis, which seems to reflect almost as much credit on the
      natural unwholesomeness of your mind as it does upon your pitiful
      ignorance of the diseases of which you discourse so glibly. We will,
      however, test your knowledge in other directions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That was a merry lesson, but, in his haste to scarify Beetle, King clean
      neglected to give him an imposition, and since at the same time he
      supplied him with many priceless adjectives for later use, Beetle was well
      content, and applied himself most seriously throughout third lesson
      (algebra with little Hartopp) to composing a poem entitled &ldquo;The
      Lazar-house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After dinner King took his house to bathe in the sea off the Pebbleridge.
      It was an old promise; but he wished he could have evaded it, for all
      Prout's lined up by the Fives Court and cheered with intention. In his
      absence not less than half the school invaded the infected dormitory to
      draw their own conclusions. The cat had gained in the last twelve hours,
      but a battlefield of the fifth day could not have been so flamboyant as
      the spies reported.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My word, she <i>is</i> doin' herself proud,&rdquo; said Stalky. &ldquo;Did you ever
      smell anything like it? Ah, an' she isn't under White's dormitory at all
      yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But she will be. Give her time,&rdquo; said Beetle. &ldquo;She'll twine like a giddy
      honeysuckle. What howlin' Lazarites they are! No house is justified in
      makin' itself a stench in the nostrils of decent&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;High-minded, pure-souled boys. Do you burn with remorse and regret?&rdquo; said
      McTurk, as they hastened to meet the house coming up from the sea. King
      had deserted it, so speech was unfettered. Round its front played a crowd
      of skirmishers&mdash;all houses mixed&mdash;flying, reforming, shrieking
      insults. On its tortured flanks marched the Hoplites, seniors hurling
      jests one after another&mdash;simple and primitive jests of the Stone Age.
      To these the three added themselves, dispassionately, with an air of
      aloofness, almost sadly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And they look all right, too,&rdquo; said Stalky. &ldquo;It can't be Rattray, can it?
      Rattray?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      No answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rattray, dear? He seems stuffy about something or other. Look here, old
      man, we don't bear any malice about your sending that soap to us last
      week, do we? Be cheerful, Rat. You can live this down all right. I dare
      say it's only a few fags. Your house is so beastly slack, though.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You aren't going back to the house, are you?&rdquo; said McTurk. The victims
      desired nothing better. &ldquo;You've simply no conception of the reek up there.
      Of course, frowzin' as you do, you wouldn't notice it; but, after this
      nice wash and the clean, fresh air, even you'd be upset. 'Much better camp
      on the Burrows. We'll get you some straw. Shall we'?&rdquo; The house hurried in
      to the tune of &ldquo;John Brown's body,&rdquo; sung by loving schoolmates, and
      barricaded themselves in their form-room. Straightway Stalky chalked a
      large cross, with &ldquo;Lord, have mercy upon us,&rdquo; on the door, and left King
      to find it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wind shifted that night and wafted a carrion-reek into Macrea's
      dormitories; so that boys in nightgowns pounded on the locked door between
      the houses, entreating King's to wash. Number Five study went to second
      lesson with not more than half a pound of camphor apiece in their
      clothing; and King, too wary to ask for explanations, gibbered a while and
      hurled them forth. So Beetle finished yet another poem at peace in the
      study.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They're usin' carbolic now. Malpas told me,&rdquo; said Stalky. &ldquo;King thinks
      it's the drains.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She'll need a lot o' carbolic,&rdquo; said McTurk. &ldquo;No harm tryin', I suppose.
      It keeps King out of mischief.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I swear I thought he was goin' to kill me when I sniffed just now. He
      didn't mind Burton major sniffin' at me the other day, though. He never
      stopped Alexander howlin' 'Stinker!' into our form-room before&mdash;before
      we doctored 'em. He just grinned,&rdquo; said Stalky. &ldquo;What was he frothing over
      you for, Beetle?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aha! That, was my subtle jape. I had him on toast. You know he always
      jaws about the learned Lipsius.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Who at the age of four'&mdash;that chap?&rdquo; said McTurk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Whenever he hears I've written a poem. Well, just as I was sittin'
      down, I whispered, 'How is our learned Lepsius?' to Burton major. Old Butt
      grinned like an owl. <i>He</i> didn't know what I was drivin' at; but King
      jolly well did. That was really why he hove us out. Ain't you grateful?
      Now shut up. I'm goin' to write the 'Ballad of the Learned Lipsius.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Keep clear of anything coarse, then,&rdquo; said Stalky. &ldquo;I shouldn't like to
      be coarse on this happy occasion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not for wo-orlds. What rhymes to 'stenches,' someone?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In Common-room at lunch King discoursed acridly to Prout of boys with
      prurient minds, who perverted their few and baleful talents to sap
      discipline and corrupt their equals, to deal in foul imagery and destroy
      reverence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you didn't seem to consider this when your house called us&mdash;ah&mdash;stinkers.
      If you hadn't assured me that you never interfere with another man's
      house, I should almost believe that it was a few casual remarks of yours
      that started all this nonsense.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Prout had endured much, for King always took his temper to meals.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You spoke to Beetle yourself, didn't you? Something about not bathing,
      and being a water-funk?&rdquo; the school chaplain put in. &ldquo;I was scoring in the
      pavilion that day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I may have&mdash;jestingly. I really don't pretend to remember every
      remark I let fall among small boys; and full well I know the Beetle has no
      feelings to be hurt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May be; but he, or they&mdash;it comes to to same thing&mdash;have the
      fiend's own knack of discovering a man's weak place. I confess I rather go
      out of my way to conciliate Number Five study. It may be soft, but so far,
      I believe, I am the only man here whom they haven't maddened by their&mdash;well&mdash;attentions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is all beside the point. I flatter myself I can deal with them alone
      as occasion arises. But if they feel themselves morally supported by those
      who should wield an absolute and open-handed justice, then I say that my
      lot is indeed a hard one. Of all things I detest, I admit that anything
      verging on disloyalty among ourselves is the first.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Common-room looked at one another out of the corners of their eyes,
      and Prout blushed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I deny it absolutely,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Er&mdash;in fact, I own that I
      personally object to all three of them. It is not fair, therefore, to&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How long do you propose to allow it?&rdquo; said King.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But surely,&rdquo; said Macrea, deserting his usual ally, &ldquo;the blame, if there
      be any, rests with you, King. You can't hold them responsible for the&mdash;you
      prefer the good old Anglo-Saxon, I believe&mdash;stink in your house. My
      boys are complaining of it now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What can you expect? You know what boys are. Naturally they take
      advantage of what to them is a heaven-sent opportunity,&rdquo; said little
      Hartopp. &ldquo;What <i>is</i> the trouble in your dormitories, King?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. King explained that as he had made it the one rule of his life never
      to interfere with another man's house, so he expected not to be too
      patently interfered with. They might be interested to learn&mdash;here the
      chaplain heaved a weary sigh&mdash;that he had taken all steps that, in
      his poor judgment, would meet the needs of the case. Nay, further, he had
      himself expended, with no thought of reimbursement, sums, the amount of
      which he would not specify, on disinfectants. This he had done because he
      knew by bitter&mdash;by most bitter&mdash;experience that the management
      of the college was slack, dilatory, and inefficient. He might even add,
      almost as slack as the administration of certain houses which now thought
      fit to sit in judgment on his actions. With a short summary of his
      scholastic career, and a precis of his qualifications, including his
      degrees, he withdrew, slamming the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heigho!&rdquo; said the chaplain. &ldquo;Ours is a dwarfing life&mdash;a belittling
      life, my brethren. God help all schoolmasters! They need it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't like the boys, I own&rdquo;&mdash;Prout dug viciously with his fork
      into the table-cloth&mdash;&ldquo;and I don't pretend to be a strong man, as you
      know. But I confess I can't see any reason why I should take steps against
      Stalky and the others because King happens to be annoyed by&mdash;by&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Falling into the pit he has digged,&rdquo; said little Hartopp. &ldquo;Certainly not,
      Prout. No one accuses you of setting one house against another through
      sheer idleness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A belittling life&mdash;a belittling life.&rdquo; The chaplain rose. &ldquo;I go to
      correct French exercises. By dinner King will have scored off some unlucky
      child of thirteen; he will repeat to us every word of his brilliant
      repartees, and all will be well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But about those three. Are they so prurient-minded?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense,&rdquo; said little Hartopp. &ldquo;If you thought for a minute, Prout, you
      would see that the 'precocious flow of fetid imagery,' that King complains
      of, is borrowed wholesale from King. He 'nursed the pinion that impelled
      the steel.' Naturally he does not approve. Come into the smoking-room for
      a minute. It isn't fair to listen to boys; but they should be now rubbing
      it into King's house outside. Little things please little minds.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The dingy den off the Common-room was never used for anything except
      gowns. Its windows were ground glass; one could not see out of it, but one
      could hear almost every word on the gravel outside. A light and wary
      footstep came up from Number Five.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rattray!&rdquo; in a subdued voice&mdash;Rattray's study fronted that way.
      &ldquo;D'you know if Mr. King's anywhere about? I've got a&mdash;&rdquo; McTurk
      discreetly left the end of the sentence open.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, he's gone out,&rdquo; said Rattray unguardedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! The learned Lipsius is airing himself, is he? His Royal Highness has
      gone to fumigate.&rdquo; McTurk climbed on the railings, where he held forth
      like the never-wearied rook.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now in all the Coll. there was no stink like the stink of King's house,
      for it stank vehemently and none knew what to make of it. Save King. And
      he washed the fags <i>privatim et seriatim</i>. In the fishpools of Hesbon
      washed he them, with an apron about his loins.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shut up, you mad Irishman!&rdquo; There was the sound of a golf-ball spurting
      up gravel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's no good getting wrathy, Rattray. We've come to jape with you. Come
      on, Beetle. They're all at home. You can wind 'em.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where's the Pomposo Stinkadore? 'Tisn't safe for a pure-souled,
      high-minded boy to be seen round his house these days. Gone out, has he?
      Never mind. I'll do the best I can, Rattray. I'm <i>in loco parentis</i>
      just now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      (&ldquo;One for you, Prout,&rdquo; whispered Macrea, for this was Mr. Prout's pet
      phrase.)
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have a few words to impart to you, my young friend. We will discourse
      together a while.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here the listening Prout sputtered: Beetle, in a strained voice, had
      chosen a favorite gambit of King's.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I repeat, Master Rattray, we will confer, and the matter of our discourse
      shall not be stinks, for that is a loathsome and obscene word. We will,
      with your good leave&mdash;granted, I trust, Master Rattray, granted, I
      trust&mdash;study this&mdash;this scabrous upheaval of latent
      demoralization. What impresses me most is not so much the blatant
      indecency with which you swagger abroad under your load of putrescence&rdquo;
       (you must imagine this discourse punctuated with golf-balls, but old
      Rattray was ever a bad shot) &ldquo;as the cynical immorality with which you
      revel in your abhorrent aromas. Far be it from me to interfere with
      another's house&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      (&ldquo;Good Lord!&rdquo; said Prout, &ldquo;but this is King.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Line for line, letter for letter; listen;&rdquo; said little Hartopp.)
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But to say that you stink, as certain lewd fellows of the baser sort
      aver, is to say nothing&mdash;less than nothing. In the absence of your
      beloved house-master, for whom no one has a higher regard than myself, I
      will, if you will allow me, explain the grossness&mdash;the unparalleled
      enormity&mdash;the appalling fetor of the stenches (I believe in the good
      old Anglo-Saxon word), stenches, sir, with which you have seen fit to
      infect your house... Oh, bother! I've forgotten the rest, but it was very
      beautiful. Aren't you grateful to us for laborin' with you this way,
      Rattray? Lots of chaps 'ud never have taken the trouble, but we're
      grateful, Rattray.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, we're horrid grateful,&rdquo; grunted McTurk. &ldquo;We don't forget that soap.
      We're polite. Why ain't you polite, Rat?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hallo!&rdquo; Stalky cantered up, his cap over one eye. &ldquo;Exhortin' the
      Whiffers, eh? I'm afraid they're too far gone to repent. Rattray! White!
      Perowne! Malpas! No answer. This is distressin'. This is truly
      distressin'. Bring out your dead, you glandered lepers!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You think yourself funny, don't you?&rdquo; said Rattray, stung from his
      dignity by this last. &ldquo;It's only a rat or something under the floor. We're
      going to have it up to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't try to shuffle it off on a poor dumb animal, and dead, too. I
      loathe prevarication. 'Pon my soul, Rattray&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hold on. The Hartoffles never said 'Pon my soul' in all his little life,&rdquo;
       said Beetle critically.
    </p>
    <p>
      (&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said Prout to little Hartopp.)
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Upon my word, sir, upon my word, sir, I expected better things of you,
      Rattray. Why can you not own up to your misdeeds like a man? Have <i>I</i>
      ever shown any lack of confidence in <i>you</i>?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      (&ldquo;It's not brutality,&rdquo; murmured little Hartopp, as though answering a
      question no one had asked. &ldquo;It's boy; only boy.&rdquo;)
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And this was the house,&rdquo; Stalky changed from a pecking, fluttering voice
      to tragic earnestness. &ldquo;This was the&mdash;the&mdash;open cesspit that
      dared to call us 'stinkers.' And now&mdash;and now, it tries to shelter
      itself behind a dead rat. You annoy me, Rattray. You disgust me! You
      irritate me unspeakably! Thank Heaven, I am a man of equable temper&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      (&ldquo;This is to your address, Macrea,&rdquo; said Prout.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I fear so, I fear so.&rdquo;)
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or I should scarcely be able to contain myself before your mocking
      visage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Cave</i>!&rdquo; in an undertone. Beetle had spied King sailing down the
      corridor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what may you be doing here, my little friends?&rdquo; the house-master
      began. &ldquo;I had a fleeting notion&mdash;correct me if I am wrong&rdquo; (the
      listeners with one accord choked)&mdash;&ldquo;that if I found you outside my
      house I should visit you with dire pains and penalties.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We were just goin' for a walk, sir,&rdquo; said Beetle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you stopped to speak to Rattray <i>en route</i>?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir. We've been throwing golf-balls,&rdquo; said Rattray, coming out of
      the study.
    </p>
    <p>
      (&ldquo;Old Rat is more of a diplomat than I thought. So far he is strictly
      within the truth,&rdquo; said little Hartopp. &ldquo;Observe the ethics of it,
      Prout.&rdquo;)
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you were sporting with them, were you? I must say I do not envy you
      your choice of associates. I fancied they might have been engaged in some
      of the prurient discourse with which they have been so disgustingly free
      of late. I should strongly advise you to direct your steps most carefully
      in the future. Pick up those golf-balls.&rdquo; He passed on.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next day Richards, who had been a carpenter in the Navy, and to whom odd
      jobs were confided, was ordered to take up a dormitory floor; for Mr. King
      held that something must have died there.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We need not neglect all our work for a trumpery incident of this nature;
      though I am quite aware that little things please little minds. Yes, I
      have decreed the boards to be taken up after lunch under Richards's
      auspices. I have no doubt it will be vastly interesting to a certain type
      of so-called intellect; but any boy of my house or another's found on the
      dormitory stairs will <i>ipso facto</i> render himself liable to three
      hundred lines.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The boys did not collect on the stairs, but most of them waited outside
      King's. Richards had been bound to cry the news from the attic window,
      and, if possible, to exhibit the corpse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Tis a cat, a dead cat!&rdquo; Richards's face showed purple at the window. He
      had been in the chamber of death and on his knees for some time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cat be blowed!&rdquo; cried McTurk. &ldquo;It's a dead fag left over from last term.
      Three cheers for King's dead fag!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They cheered lustily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Show it, show it! Let's have a squint at it!&rdquo; yelled the juniors. &ldquo;Give
      her to the Bug-hunters.&rdquo; (This was the Natural History Society). &ldquo;The cat
      looked at the King&mdash;and died of it! Hoosh! Yai! Yaow! Maiow! Ftzz!&rdquo;
       were some of the cries that followed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again Richards appeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She've been&rdquo;&mdash;he checked himself suddenly&mdash;&ldquo;dead a long taime.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The school roared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, come on out for a walk,&rdquo; said Stalky in a well-chosen pause. &ldquo;It's
      all very disgustin', and I do hope the Lazar-house won't do it again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do what?&rdquo; a King's boy cried furiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kill a poor innocent cat every time you want to get off washing. It's
      awfully hard to distinguish between you as it is. I prefer the cat, I must
      say. She isn't quite so whiff. What are you goin' to do, Beetle?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Je vais gloater. Je vais gloater tout le blessed afternoon. Jamais
      j'ai gloate' comme je gloaterai aujourd'hui. Nous bunkerons aux</i>
      bunkers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And it seemed good to them so to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      Down in the basement, where the gas flickers and the boots stand in racks,
      Richards, amid his blacking-brushes, held forth to Oke of the Common-room,
      Gumbly of the dining-halls, and fair Lena of the laundry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yiss. Her were in a shockin' staate an' condition. Her nigh made me sick,
      I tal 'ee. But I rowted un out, and I rowted un out, an' I made all
      shipshape, though her smelt like to bilges.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Her died mousin', I reckon, poor thing,&rdquo; said Lena.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then her moused different to any made cat o' God's world, Lena. I up with
      the top-board, an' she were lying on her back, an' I turned un ovver with
      the brume-handle, an' 'twas her back was all covered with the plaster from
      'twixt the lathin'. Yiss, I tal 'ee. An' under her head there lay, like,
      so's to say, a little pillow o' plaster druv up in front of her by raison
      of her slidin' along on her back. No cat niver went mousin' on her back,
      Lena. Some one had shoved her along right underneath, so far as they could
      shove un. Cats don't make theyselves pillows for to die on. Shoved along,
      she were, when she was settin' for to be cold, laike.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yeou'm too clever to live, Fatty. Yeou go get wed an' taught some
      sense,&rdquo; said Lena, the affianced of Gumbly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Larned a little 'fore iver some maidens was born. Sarved in the Queen's
      Navy, I have, where yeou'm taught to use your eyes. Yeou go 'tend your own
      business, Lena.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do 'ee mean what you'm been tellin' us?&rdquo; said Oke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ask me no questions, I'll give 'ee no lies. Bullet-hole clane thru from
      side to side, an' tu heart-ribs broke like withies. I seed un when I
      turned un ovver. They're clever, oh, they'm clever, but they'm not too
      clever for old Richards! 'Twas on the born tip o' my tongue to tell, tu,
      but... he said us niver washed, he did. Let his dom boys call us
      'stinkers,' he did. Sarve un dom well raight, I say!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Richards spat on a fresh boot and fell to his work, chuckling.

      THE IMPRESSIONISTS.
    </h2>
    <p>
      They had dropped into the chaplain's study for a Saturday night smoke&mdash;-all
      four house-masters&mdash;and the three briars and the one cigar reeking in
      amity proved the Rev. John Gillett's good generalship. Since the discovery
      of the cat, King had been too ready to see affront where none was meant,
      and the Reverend John, buffer-state and general confidant, had worked for
      a week to bring about a good understanding. He was fat, clean-shaven,
      except for a big mustache, of an imperturbable good temper, and, those who
      loved him least said, a guileful Jesuit. He smiled benignantly upon his
      handiwork&mdash;four sorely tried men talking without very much malice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now remember,&rdquo; he said, when the conversation turned that way, &ldquo;I impute
      nothing. But every time that any one has taken direct steps against Number
      Five study, the issue has been more or less humiliating to the taker.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can't admit that. I pulverize the egregious Beetle daily for his soul's
      good; and the others with him,&rdquo; said King.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, take your own case, King, and go back a couple of years. Do you
      remember when Prout and you were on their track for hutting and trespass,
      wasn't it? Have you forgotten Colonel Dabney?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The others laughed. King did not care to be reminded of his career as a
      poacher.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was one instance. Again, when you had rooms below them&mdash;I
      always said that that was entering the lion's den&mdash;you turned them
      out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For making disgusting noises. Surely, Gillett, you don't excuse&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All I say is that you turned them out. That same evening your study was
      wrecked.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By Rabbits-Eggs&mdash;most beastly drunk&mdash;from the road,&rdquo; said King.
      &ldquo;What has that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Reverend John went on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lastly, they conceive that aspersions are cast upon their personal
      cleanliness&mdash;a most delicate matter with all boys. Ve-ry good.
      Observe how, in each case, the punishment fits the crime. A week after
      your house calls them 'stinkers,' King, your house is, not to put too fine
      a point on it, stunk out by a dead cat who chooses to die in the one spot
      where she can annoy you most. Again the long arm of coincidence! <i>Summa</i>.
      You accuse them of trespass. Through some absurd chain of circumstances&mdash;they
      may or may not be at the other end of it&mdash;you and Prout are made to
      appear as trespassers. You evict them. For a time your study is made
      untenable. I have drawn the parallel in the last case. Well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She was under the centre of White's dormitory,&rdquo; said King. &ldquo;There are
      double floor-boards there to deaden noise. No boy, even in my own house,
      could possibly have pried up the boards without leaving some trace&mdash;and
      Rabbits-Eggs was phenomenally drunk that other night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are singularly favored by fortune. That is all I ever said.
      Personally, I like them immensely, and I believe I have a little of their
      confidence. I confess I like being called 'Padre.' They are at peace with
      me; consequently I am not treated to bogus confessions of theft.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean Mason's case?&rdquo; said Prout heavily. &ldquo;That always struck me as
      peculiarly scandalous. I thought the Head should have taken up the matter
      more thoroughly. Mason may be misguided, but at least he is thoroughly
      sincere and means well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I confess I cannot agree with you, Prout,&rdquo; said the Reverend John. &ldquo;He
      jumped at some silly tale of theft on their part; accepted another boy's
      evidence without, so far as I can see, any inquiry; and&mdash;frankly, I
      think he deserved all he got.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They deliberately outraged Mason's best feelings,&rdquo; said Prout. &ldquo;A word to
      me on their part would have saved the whole thing. But they preferred to
      lure him on; to play on his ignorance of their characters&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That may be,&rdquo; said King, &ldquo;but I don't like Mason. I dislike him for the
      very reason that Prout advances to his credit. He means well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our criminal tradition is not theft&mdash;among ourselves, at least,&rdquo;
       said little Hartopp.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For the head of a house that raided seven head of cattle from the
      innocent pot-wallopers of Northam, isn't that rather a sweeping
      statement?&rdquo; said Macrae.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Precisely so,&rdquo; said Hartopp, unabashed. &ldquo;That, with gate-lifting, and a
      little poaching and hawk-hunting on the cliffs, is our salvation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It does us far more harm as a school&mdash;&rdquo; Prout began.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Than any hushed-up scandal could? Quite so. Our reputation among the
      farmers is most unsavory. But I would much sooner deal with any amount of
      ingenious crime of that nature than&mdash;some other offenses.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They may be all right, but they are unboylike, abnormal, and, in my
      opinion, unsound,&rdquo; Prout insisted. &ldquo;The moral effect of their performances
      must pave the way for greater harm. It makes me doubtful how to deal with
      them. I might separate them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You might, of course; but they have gone up the school together for six
      years. <i>I</i> shouldn't care to do it,&rdquo; said Macrae.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They use the editorial 'we,'&rdquo; said King, irrelevantly. &ldquo;It annoys me.
      'Where's your prose, Corkran?' 'Well, sir, we haven't quite done it yet.'
      'We'll bring it in a minute,' and so on. And the same with the others.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's great virtue in that 'we,'&rdquo; said little Hartopp. &ldquo;You know I take
      them for trig. McTurk may have some conception of the meaning of it; but
      Beetle is as the brutes that perish about sines and cosines. He copies
      serenely from Stalky, who positively rejoices in mathematics.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why don't you stop it?&rdquo; said Prout.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It rights itself at the exams. Then Beetle shows up blank sheets, and
      trusts to his 'English' to save him from a fall. I fancy he spends most of
      his time with me in writing verse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish to Heaven he would transfer a little of his energy in that
      direction to Elegiaes.&rdquo; King jerked himself upright. &ldquo;He is, with the
      single exception of Stalky, the very vilest manufacturer of 'barbarous
      hexameters' that I have ever dealt with.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The work is combined in that study,&rdquo; said the chaplain. &ldquo;Stalky does the
      mathematics, McTurk the Latin, and Beetle attends to their English and
      French. At least, when he was in the sick-house last month&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Malingering,&rdquo; Prout interjected.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite possibly. I found a very distinct falling off in their 'Roman d'un
      Jeune Homme Pauvre' translations.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think it is profoundly immoral,&rdquo; said Prout. &ldquo;I've always been opposed
      to the study system.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would be hard to find any study where the boys don't help each other;
      but in Number Five the thing has probably been reduced to a system,&rdquo; said
      little Hartopp. &ldquo;They have a system in most things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They confess as much,&rdquo; said the Reverend John. &ldquo;I've seen McTurk being
      hounded up the stairs to elegise the 'Elegy in a Churchyard,' while Beetle
      and Stalky went to punt-about.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It amounts to systematic cribbing,&rdquo; said Prout, his voice growing deeper
      and deeper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No such thing,&rdquo; little Hartopp returned. &ldquo;You can't teach a cow the
      violin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In intention it is cribbing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But we spoke under the seal of the confessional, didn't we?&rdquo; said the
      Reverend John.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You say you've heard them arranging their work in this way, Gillett,&rdquo;
       Prout persisted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good Heavens! Don't make me Queen's evidence, my dear fellow. Hartopp is
      equally incriminated. If they ever found out that I had sneaked, our
      relations would suffer&mdash;and I value them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think your attitude in this matter is weak,&rdquo; said Prout, looking round
      for support. &ldquo;It would be really better to break up the study&mdash;for a
      while&mdash;wouldn't it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, break it up by all means,&rdquo; said Macrae. &ldquo;We shall see then if
      Gillett's theory holds water.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be wise, Prout. Leave them alone, or calamity will overtake you; and what
      is much more important, they will be annoyed with me. I am too fat, alas!
      to be worried by bad boys. Where are you going?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense! They would not dare&mdash;-but I am going to think this out,&rdquo;
       said Prout. &ldquo;It needs thought. In intention they cribbed, and I must think
      out my duty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's perfectly capable of putting the boys on their honor. It's <i>I</i>
      that am a fool.&rdquo; The Reverend John looked round remorsefully. &ldquo;Never again
      will I forget that a master is not a man. Mark my words,&rdquo; said the
      Reverend John. &ldquo;There will be trouble.&rdquo;
     </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   But by the yellow Tiber
   Was tumult and affright.
</pre>
    <p>
      Out of the blue sky (they were still rejoicing over the cat war) Mr. Prout
      had dropped into Number Five, read them a lecture on the enormity of
      cribbing, and bidden them return to the form-rooms on Monday. They had
      raged, solo and chorus, all through the peaceful Sabbath, for their sin
      was more or less the daily practice of all the studies.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's the good of cursing?&rdquo; said Stalky at last. &ldquo;We're all in the same
      boat. We've got to go back and consort with the house. A locker in the
      form-room, and a seat at prep. in Number Twelve.&rdquo; (He looked regretfully
      round the cozy study which McTurk, their leader in matters of Art, had
      decorated with a dado, a stencil, and cretonne hangings.)
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes! Heffy lurchin' into the form-rooms like a frowzy old retriever, to
      see if we aren't up to something. You know he never leaves his house
      alone, these days,&rdquo; said McTurk. &ldquo;Oh, it will be giddy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why aren't you down watchin' cricket? I like a robust, healthy boy. You
      mustn't frowst in a form-room. Why don't you take an interest in your
      house? Yah!&rdquo; quoted Beetle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, why don't we? Let's! We'll take an interest in the house. We'll take
      no end of interest in the house! He hasn't had us in the form-rooms for a
      year. We've learned a lot since then. Oh, we'll make it a be-autiful house
      before we've done! 'Member that chap in 'Eric' or 'St. Winifred's'&mdash;Belial
      somebody? I'm goin' to be Belial,&rdquo; said Stalky, with an ensnaring grin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Right O,&rdquo; said Beetle, &ldquo;and I'll be Mammon. I'll lend money at usury&mdash;that's
      what they do at all schools accordin' to the B.O.P. Penny a week on a
      shillin'. That'll startle Heffy's weak intellect. You can be Lucifer,
      Turkey.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What have I got to do?&rdquo; McTurk also smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Head conspiracies&mdash;and cabals&mdash;and boycotts. Go in for that
      'stealthy intrigue' that Heffy is always talkin' about. Come on!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The house received them on their fall with the mixture of jest and
      sympathy always extended to boys turned out of their study. The known
      aloofness of the three made them more interesting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite like old times, ain't it?&rdquo; Stalky selected a locker and flung in
      his books. &ldquo;We've come to sport with you, my young friends, for a while,
      because our beloved house-master has hove us out of our diggin's.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Serve you jolly well right,&rdquo; said Orrin, &ldquo;you cribbers!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This will never do,&rdquo; said Stalky. &ldquo;We can't maintain our giddy prestige,
      Orrin, de-ah, if you make these remarks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They wrapped themselves lovingly about the boy, thrust him to the opened
      window, and drew down the sash to the nape of his neck. With an equal
      swiftness they tied his thumbs together behind his back with a piece of
      twine, and then, because he kicked furiously, removed his shoes. There Mr.
      Prout happened to find him a few minutes later, guillotined and helpless,
      surrounded by a convulsed crowd who would not assist.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stalky, in an upper form-room, had gathered himself allies against
      vengeance. Orrin presently tore up at the head of a boarding party, and
      the form-room grew one fog of dust through which boys wrestled, stamped,
      shouted, and yelled. A desk was carried away in the tumult, a knot of
      warriors reeled into and split a door-panel, a window was broken, and a
      gas-jet fell. Under cover of the confusion the three escaped to the
      corridor, whence they called in and sent up passers-by to the fray.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rescue, Kings! Kings! Kings! Number Twelve form-room! Rescue, Prouts&mdash;Prouts!
      Rescue, Macraes! Rescue, Hartopps!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The juniors hurried out like bees aswarm, asking no questions, clattered
      up the staircase, and added themselves to the embroilment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not bad for the first evening's work,&rdquo; said Stalky, rearranging his
      collar. &ldquo;I fancy Prout'll be somewhat annoyed. We'd better establish an
      alibi.&rdquo; So they sat on Mr. King's railings till prep.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see,&rdquo; quoth Stalky, as they strolled up to prep. with the ignoble
      herd, &ldquo;if you get the houses well mixed up an' scufflin', it's even
      bettin' that some ass will start a real row. Hullo, Orrin, you look rather
      metagrobolized.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was all your fault, you beast! You started it. We've got two hundred
      lines apiece, and Heffy's lookin' for you. Just see what that swine Malpas
      did to my eye!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I like your saying we started it. Who called us cribbers? Can't your
      infant mind connect cause and effect yet? Some day you'll find out that it
      don't pay to jest with Number Five.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where's that shillin' you owe me?&rdquo; said Beetle suddenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stalky could not see Prout behind him, but returned the lead without a
      quaver. &ldquo;I only owed you ninepence, you old usurer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You've forgotten the interest,&rdquo; said McTurk. &ldquo;A halfpenny a week per bob
      is Beetle's charge. You must be beastly rich, Beetle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Beetle lent me sixpence.&rdquo; Stalky came to a full stop and made as to
      work it out on his fingers. &ldquo;Sixpence on the nineteenth, didn't he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; but you've forgotten you paid no interest on the other bob&mdash;the
      one I lent you before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you took my watch as security.&rdquo; The game was developing itself almost
      automatically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind. Pay me my interest, or I'll charge you interest on interest.
      Remember, I've got your note-of-hand!&rdquo; shouted Beetle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are a cold-blooded Jew,&rdquo; Stalky groaned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; said McTurk very loudly indeed, and started as Prout came upon
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn't see you in that disgraceful affair in the form-room just now,&rdquo;
       said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, sir? We're just come up from Mr. King's,&rdquo; said Stalky. &ldquo;Please,
      sir, what am I to do about prep.? They've broken the desk you told me to
      sit at, and the form's just swimming with ink.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Find another seat&mdash;find another seat. D'you expect me to dry-nurse
      you? I wish to know whether you are in the habit of advancing money to
      your associates, Beetle?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir; not as a general rule, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a most reprehensible habit. I thought that my house, at least,
      would be free from it. Even with my opinion of you, I hardly thought it
      was one of your vices.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's no harm in lending money, sir, is there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not going to bandy words with you on your notions of morality. How
      much have you lent Corkran?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I don't quite know,&rdquo; said Beetle. It is difficult to improvise a
      going concern on the spur of the minute.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You seemed certain enough just now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think it's two and fourpence,&rdquo; said McTurk, with a glance of cold scorn
      at Beetle. In the hopelessly involved finances of the study there was just
      that sum to which both McTurk and Beetle laid claim, as their share in the
      pledging of Stalky's second-best Sunday trousers. But Stalky had
      maintained for two terms that the money was his &ldquo;commission&rdquo; for effecting
      the pawn; and had, of course, spent it on a study &ldquo;brew.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Understand this, then. You are not to continue your operations as a
      money-lender. Two and fourpence, you said, Corkran?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Stalky had said nothing, and continued so to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your influence for evil is quite strong enough without buying a hold over
      your companions.&rdquo; He felt in his pockets, and (oh joy!) produced a florin
      and fourpence. &ldquo;Bring me what you call Corkran's note-of-hand, and be
      thankful that I do not carry the matter any further. The money is stopped
      from your pocket-money, Corkran. The receipt to my study, at once!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Little they cared! Two and fourpence in a lump is worth six weekly
      sixpences any hungry day of the week.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what the dooce is a note-of-hand?&rdquo; said Beetle. &ldquo;I only read about it
      in a book.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now you've jolly well got to make one,&rdquo; said Stalky.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;but our ink don't turn black till next day. S'pose he'll spot
      that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not him. He's too worried,&rdquo; said McTurk. &ldquo;Sign your name on a bit of
      impot-paper, Stalky, and write, 'I O U two and fourpence.' Aren't you
      grateful to me for getting that out of Prout? Stalky'd never have paid...
      Why, you ass!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mechanically Beetle had handed over the money to Stalky as treasurer of
      the study. The custom of years is not lightly broken. In return for the
      document, Prout expounded to Beetle the enormity of money-lending, which,
      like everything except compulsory cricket, corrupted houses and destroyed
      good feeling among boys, made youth cold and calculating, and opened the
      door to all evil. Finally, did Beetle know of any other cases? If so, it
      was his duty as proof of repentance to let his house-master know. No names
      need be mentioned.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beetle did not know&mdash;at least, he was not quite sure, sir. How could
      he give evidence against his friends? The house might, of course&mdash;here
      he feigned an anguished delicacy&mdash;be full of it. He was not in a
      position to say. He had not met with any open competition in his trade;
      but if Mr. Prout considered it was a matter that affected the honor of the
      house (Mr. Prout did consider it precisely that), perhaps the
      house-prefects would be better...
    </p>
    <p>
      He spun it out till half-way through prep.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And,&rdquo; said the amateur Shylock, returning to the form-room and dropping
      at Stalky's side, &ldquo;if he don't think the house is putrid with it, I'm
      several Dutch-men&mdash;that's all... I've been to Mr. Prout's study,
      sir.&rdquo; This to the prep.-master. &ldquo;He said I could sit where I liked, sir...
      Oh, he is just tricklin' with emotion... Yes, sir, I'm only askin' Corkran
      to let me have a dip in his ink.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After prayers, on the road to the dormitories, Harrison and Craye, senior
      house-prefects, zealous in their office, waylaid them with great anger.
      &ldquo;What have you been doing to Heffy this time, Beetle? He's been jawing us
      all the evening.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What has His Serene Transparency been vexin' you for?&rdquo; said McTurk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About Beetle lendin' money to Stalky,&rdquo; began Harrison; &ldquo;and then Beetle
      went and told him that there was any amount of money-lendin' in the
      house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, you don't,&rdquo; said Beetle, sitting on a boot-basket. &ldquo;That's just what
      I didn't tell him. I spoke the giddy truth. He asked me if there was much
      of it in the house; and I said I didn't know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He thinks you're a set of filthy Shylocks,&rdquo; said McTurk. &ldquo;It's just as
      well for you he don't think you're burglars. You know he never gets a
      notion out of his conscientious old head.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well-meanin' man. Did it all for the best.&rdquo; Stalky curled gracefully
      round the stair-rail. &ldquo;Head in a drain-pipe. Full confession in the left
      boot. Bad for the honor of the house&mdash;very.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shut up,&rdquo; said Harrison. &ldquo;You chaps always behave as if you were jawin'
      us when we come to jaw you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're a lot too cheeky,&rdquo; said Craye.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't quite see where the cheek comes in, except on your part, in
      interferin' with a private matter between me an' Beetle after it has been
      settled by Prout.&rdquo; Stalky winked cheerfully at the others.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's the worst of clever little swots,&rdquo; said McTurk, addressing the
      gas. &ldquo;They get made prefects before they have any tact, and then they
      annoy chaps who could really help 'em to look after the honor of the
      house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We won't trouble you to do that!&rdquo; said Craye hotly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then what are you badgerin' us for?&rdquo; said Beetle. &ldquo;On your own showing,
      you've been so beastly slack, looking after the house, that Prout believes
      it's a nest of money-lenders. I've told him that I've lent money to
      Stalky, and no one else. I don't know whether he believes me, but that
      finishes my case. The rest is your business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now we find out,&rdquo; Stalky's voice rose, &ldquo;that there is apparently an
      organized conspiracy throughout the house. For aught we know, the fags may
      be lendin' and borrowin' far beyond their means. We aren't responsible for
      it. We're only the rank and file.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you surprised we don't wish to associate with the house?&rdquo; said
      McTurk, with dignity. &ldquo;We've kept ourselves to ourselves in our study till
      we were turned out, and now we find ourselves let in for for this sort of
      thing. It's simply disgraceful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you hector and bullyrag us on the stairs,&rdquo; said Stalky, &ldquo;about
      matters that are your business entirely. You know we aren't prefects.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You threatened us with a prefect's lickin' just now,&rdquo; said Beetle, boldly
      inventing as he saw the bewilderment in the faces of the enemy. &ldquo;And if
      you expect you'll gain anything from us by your way of approachin' us,
      you're jolly well mistaken. That's all. Good-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They clattered upstairs, injured virtue on every inch of their backs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But&mdash;but what the dickens have we done?&rdquo; said Harrison, amazedly, to
      Craye.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know. Only&mdash;it always happens that way when one has anything
      to do with them. They're so beastly plausible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Mr. Prout called the good boys into his study anew, and succeeded in
      sinking both his and their innocent minds ten fathoms deeper in
      blindfolded bedazement. He spoke of steps and measures, of tone and
      loyalty in the house and to the house, and urged them to take up the
      matter tactfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      So they demanded of Beetle whether he had any connection with any other
      establishment. Beetle promptly went to his house-master, and wished to
      know by what right Harrison and Craye had reopened a matter already
      settled between him and his house-master. In injured innocence no boy
      excelled Beetle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then it occurred to Prout that he might have been unfair to the culprit,
      who had not striven to deny or palliate his offense. He sent for Harrison
      and Craye, reprehending them very gently for the tone they had adopted to
      a repentant sinner, and when they returned to their study, they used the
      language of despair. They then made headlong inquisition through the
      house, driving the fags to the edge of hysterics, and unearthing, with
      tremendous pomp and parade, the natural and inevitable system of small
      loans that prevails among small boys.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see, Harrison, Thornton minor lent me a penny last Saturday, because
      I was fined for breaking the window; and I spent it at Keyte's. I didn't
      know there was any harm in it. And Wray major borrowed twopence from me
      when my uncle sent me a post-office order&mdash;I cashed it at Keyte's&mdash;for
      five bob; but he'll pay me back before the holidays. We didn't know there
      was anything wrong in it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They waded through hours of this kind of thing, but found no usury, or
      anything approaching to Beetle's gorgeous scale of interest. The seniors&mdash;for
      the school had no tradition of deference to prefects outside compulsory
      games&mdash;told them succinctly to go about their business. They would
      not give evidence on any terms. Harrison was one idiot, and Craye was
      another; but the greatest of all, they said, was their house-master.
    </p>
    <p>
      When a house is thoroughly upset, however good its conscience, it breaks
      into knots and coteries&mdash;small gatherings in the twilight, box-room
      committees, and groups in the corridor. And when from group to group, with
      an immense affectation of secrecy, three wicked boys steal, crying &ldquo;<i>Cave''</i>&rdquo;
       when there is no need of caution, and whispering &ldquo;Don't tell!&rdquo; on the
      heels of trumpery confidences that instant invented, a very fine air of
      plot and intrigue can be woven round such a house.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the end of a few days, it dawned on Prout that he moved in an
      atmosphere of perpetual ambush. Mysteries hedged him on all sides,
      warnings ran before his heavy feet, and countersigns were muttered behind
      his attentive back. McTurk and Stalky invented many absurd and idle
      phrases&mdash;catch-words that swept through the house as fire through
      stubble. It was a rare jest, and the only practical outcome of the Usury
      Commission, that one boy should say to a friend, with awful gravity, &ldquo;Do
      you think there's much of it going on in the house?&rdquo; The other would
      reply, &ldquo;Well, one can't be too careful, you know.&rdquo; The effect on a
      house-master of humane conscience and good intent may be imagined. Again,
      a man who has sincerely devoted himself to gaining the esteem of his
      charges does not like to hear himself described, even at a distance, as
      &ldquo;Popularity Prout&rdquo; by a dark and scowling Celt with a fluent tongue. A
      rumor that stories&mdash;unusual stories&mdash;are told in the form-rooms,
      between the lights, by a boy who does not command his confidence, agitates
      such a man; and even elaborate and tender politeness&mdash;for the
      courtesy wise-grown men offer to a bewildered child was the courtesy that
      Stalky wrapped round Prout&mdash;restores not his peace of mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The tone of the house seems changed&mdash;changed for the worse,&rdquo; said
      Prout to Harrison and Craye. &ldquo;Have you noticed it? I don't for an instant
      impute&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He never imputed anything; but, on the other hand, he never did anything
      else, and, with the best intentions in the world, he had reduced the
      house-prefects to a state as nearly bordering on nervous irritation as
      healthy boys can know. Worst of all, they began at times to wonder whether
      Stalky &amp; Co. had not some truth in their often-repeated assertions
      that Prout was a gloomy ass.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As you know, I am not the kind of man who puts himself out for every
      little thing he hears. I believe in letting the house work out their own
      salvation&mdash;with a light guiding hand on the reins, of course. But
      there is a perceptible lack of reverence&mdash;-a lower tone in matters
      that touch the honor of the house, a sort of hardness.&rdquo;
     </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   Oh, Prout he is a nobleman, a nobleman, a nobleman!
       Our Heffy is a nobleman&mdash;
       He does an awful lot,
   Because his popularity
   Oh, pop-u-pop-u-larity&mdash;
   His giddy popularity
       Would suffer did he not!
</pre>
    <p>
      The study door stood ajar; and the song, borne by twenty clear voices,
      came faint from a form-room. The fags rather liked the tune; the words
      were Beetle's.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's a thing no sensible man objects to,&rdquo; said Prout with a lop-sided
      smile; &ldquo;but you know straws show which way the wind blows. Can you trace
      it to any direct influence? I am speaking to you now as heads of the
      house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There isn't the least doubt of it,&rdquo; said Harrison angrily. &ldquo;I know what
      you mean, sir. It all began when Number Five study came to the form-rooms.
      There's no use blinkin' it, Craye. You know that, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They make things rather difficult for us, sometimes,&rdquo; said Craye. &ldquo;It's
      more their manner than anything else, that Harrison means.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do they hamper you in the discharge of your duties, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, no, sir. They only look on and grin&mdash;and turn up their noses
      generally.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said Prout sympathetically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think, sir,&rdquo; said Craye, plunging into the business boldly, &ldquo;it would
      be a great deal better if they were sent back to their study&mdash;better
      for the house. They are rather old to be knocking about the form-rooms.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are younger than Orrin, or Flint, and a dozen others that I can
      think of.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir; but that's different, somehow. They're rather influential. They
      have a knack of upsettin' things in a quiet way that one can't take hold
      of. At least, if one does&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you think they would be better in their own study again?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Emphatically Harrison and Craye were of that opinion. As Harrison said to
      Craye, afterwards, &ldquo;They've weakened our authority. They're too big to
      lick; they've made an exhibition of us over this usury business, and we're
      a laughing-stock to the rest of the school. I'm going up (for Sandhurst,
      understood) next term. They've managed to knock me out of half my work
      already with their&mdash;their lunacy. If they go back to their study we
      may have a little peace.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hullo, Harrison.&rdquo; McTurk ambled round the corner, with a roving eye on
      all possible horizons. &ldquo;Bearin' up, old man? That's right. Live it down!
      Live it down!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What d'you mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You look a little pensive,&rdquo; said McTurk. &ldquo;Exhaustin' job superintendin'
      the honor of the house, ain't it? By the way, how are you off for
      mares'-nests?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; said Harrison, hoping for instant reward. &ldquo;We've recommended
      Prout to let you go back to your study.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The dooce you have! And who under the sun are <i>you</i> to interfere
      between us and our house-master? Upon my Sam, you two try us very hard&mdash;you
      do, indeed. Of course we don't know how far you abuse your position to
      prejudice us with Mr. Prout; but when you deliberately stop me to tell me
      you've been makin' arrangements behind our back&mdash;in secret&mdash;with
      Prout&mdash;I&mdash;I don't know really what we ought to do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's beastly unfair!&rdquo; cried Craye.
    </p>
<p>
&ldquo;It is.&rdquo; McTurk had adopted a ghastly solemnity that sat well on his
long, lean face. &ldquo;Hang it all! A prefect's one thing and an usher's
another; but you seem to combine 'em. You recommend this&mdash;you recommend
that! <i>You</i> say how and when we go back to our study!&rdquo;
 </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But&mdash;but&mdash;we thought you'd like it, Turkey. We did, indeed. You
      know you'll be ever so much more comfortable there.&rdquo; Harrison's voice was
      almost tearful.
    </p>
    <p>
      McTurk turned away as though to hide his emotions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They're broke!&rdquo; He hunted up Stalky and Beetle in a box-room. &ldquo;They're
      sick! They've been beggin' Heffy to let us go back to Number Five. Poor
      devils! Poor little devils!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's the olive branch,&rdquo; was Stalky's comment. &ldquo;It's the giddy white flag,
      by gum! Come to think of it, we <i>have</i> metagrobolized 'em.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Just after tea that day, Mr. Prout sent for them to say that if they chose
      to ruin their future by neglecting their work, it was entirely their own
      affair. He wished them, however, to understand that their presence in the
      form-rooms could not be tolerated one hour longer. He personally did not
      care to think of the time he must spend in eliminating the traces of their
      evil influences. How far Beetle had pandered to the baser side of youthful
      imagination he would ascertain later; and Beetle might be sure that if Mr.
      Prout came across any soul-corrupting consequences&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Consequences of what, sir?&rdquo; said Beetle, genuinely bewildered this time;
      and McTurk quietly kicked him on the ankle for being &ldquo;fetched&rdquo; by Prout.
      Beetle, the house-master continued, knew very well what was intended. Evil
      and brief had been their careers under his eye; and as one standing <i>in
      loco parentis</i> to their yet uncontaminated associates, he was bound to
      take his precautions. The return of the study key closed the sermon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what was the baser-side-of-imagination business?&rdquo; said Beetle on the
      stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never knew such an ass as you are for justifyin' yourself,&rdquo; said
      McTurk. &ldquo;I hope I jolly well skinned your ankle. Why do you let yourself
      be drawn by everybody?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Draws be blowed! I must have tickled him up in some way I didn't know
      about. If I'd had a notion of that before, of course I could have rubbed
      it in better. It's too late now. What a pity! 'Baser side.' What <i>was</i>
      he drivin' at?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind,&rdquo; said Stalky. &ldquo;I knew we could make it a happy little house.
      I said so, remember&mdash;but I swear I didn't think we'd do it so soon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Prout most firmly in Common-room. &ldquo;I maintain that Gillett is
      wrong. True, I let them return to their study.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With your known views on cribbing, too?&rdquo; purred little Hartopp. &ldquo;What an
      immoral compromise!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One moment,&rdquo; said the Reverend John. &ldquo;I&mdash;we&mdash;all of us have
      exercised an absolutely heart-breaking discretion for the last ten days.
      Now we want to know. Confess&mdash;have you known a happy minute since&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As regards my house, I have not,&rdquo; said Prout. &ldquo;But you are entirely wrong
      in your estimate of those boys. In justice to the others&mdash;in
      self-defence&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha! I said it would come to that,&rdquo; murmured the Reverend John.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&mdash;I was forced to send them back. Their moral influence was
      unspeakable&mdash;simply unspeakable.&rdquo;
     </p>
<p>
And bit by bit he told his tale, beginning with Beetle's usury, and
ending with the house-prefects' appeal.

</p>
<p>

&ldquo;Beetle in the <i>ro'le</i> of Shylock is new to me,&rdquo; said King, with
twitching lips. &ldquo;I heard rumors of it&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Before?&rdquo; said Prout.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, after you had dealt with them; but I was careful not to inquire. I
      never interfere with&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I myself,&rdquo; said Hartopp, &ldquo;would cheerfully give him five shillings if he
      could work out one simple sum in compound interest without three gross
      errors.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why&mdash;why&mdash;why!&rdquo; Mason, the mathematical master, stuttered, a
      fierce joy on his face, &ldquo;you've been had&mdash;precisely the same as me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so you held an inquiry?&rdquo; Little Hartopp's voice drowned Mason's ere
      Prout caught the import of the sentence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The boy himself hinted at the existence of a deal of it in the house,&rdquo;
       said Prout.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is past master in that line,&rdquo; said the chaplain. &ldquo;But, as regards the
      honor of the house&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They lowered it in a week. I have striven to build it up for years. My
      own house-prefects&mdash;and boys do not willingly complain of each other&mdash;besought
      me to get rid of them. You say you have their confidence, Gillett: they
      may tell you another tale. As far as I am concerned, they may go to the
      devil in their own way. I'm sick and tired of them,&rdquo; said Prout bitterly.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it was the Reverend John, with a smiling countenance, who went to the
      devil just after Number Five had cleared away a very pleasant little brew
      (it cost them two and fourpence) and was settling down to prep.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come in, Padre, come in,&rdquo; said Stalky, thrusting forward the best chair.
      &ldquo;We've only met you official-like these last ten days.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were under sentence,&rdquo; said the Reverend John. &ldquo;I do not consort with
      malefactors.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, but we're restored again,&rdquo; said McTurk. &ldquo;Mr. Prout has relented.&rdquo;
     </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Without a stain on our characters,&rdquo; said Beetle. &ldquo;It was a painful
episode, Padre, most painful.&rdquo;

</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Now, consider for a while, and perpend, <i>mes enfants</i>. It is about
your characters that I've called to-night. In the language of the
schools, what the dooce <i>have</i> you been up to in Mr. Prout's house? It
isn't anything to laugh over. He says that you so lowered the tone of
the house he had to pack you back to your studies. Is that true?&rdquo;
 </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Every word of it, Padre.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't be flippant, Turkey. Listen to me. I've told you very often that no
      boys in the school have a greater influence for good or evil than you
      have. You know I don't talk about ethics and moral codes, because I don't
      believe that the young of the human animal realizes what they mean for
      some years to come. All the same, I don't want to think you've been
      perverting the juniors. Don't interrupt, Beetle. Listen to me. Mr. Prout
      has a notion that you have been corrupting your associates somehow or
      other.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Prout has so many notions, Padre,&rdquo; said Beetle wearily. &ldquo;Which one is
      this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, he tells me that he heard you telling a story in the twilight in
      the form-room, in a whisper. And Orrin said, just as he opened the door,
      'Shut up, Beetle; it's too beastly.' Now then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You remember Mrs. Oliphant's 'Beleaguered City' that you lent me last
      term?&rdquo; said Beetle.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Padre nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I got the notion out of that. Only, instead of a city, I made it the
      Coll. in a fog&mdash;besieged by ghosts of dead boys, who hauled chaps out
      of their beds in the dormitory. All the names are quite real. You tell it
      in a whisper, you know with the names. Orrin didn't like it one little
      bit. None of 'em have ever let me finish it. It gets just awful at the end
      part.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why in the world didn't you explain to Mr. Prout, instead of leaving
      him under the impression&mdash;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Padre Sahib,&rdquo; said McTurk, &ldquo;it isn't the least good explainin' to Mr.
      Prout. If he hasn't one impression, he's bound to have another.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He'd do it with the best o' motives. He's <i>in loco parentis</i>,&rdquo;
       purred Stalky.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You young demons!&rdquo; the Reverend John replied. &ldquo;And am I to understand
      that the&mdash;-the usury business was another of your house-master's
      impressions?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;we helped a little in that,&rdquo; said Stalky. &ldquo;I did owe Beetle
      two and fourpence at least, Beetle says I did, but I never intended to pay
      him. Then we started a bit of an argument on the stairs, and&mdash;and Mr.
      Prout dropped into it accidental. That was how it was, Padre. He paid me
      cash down like a giddy Dook (stopped it out of my pocket-money just the
      same), and Beetle gave him my note-of-hand all correct. I don't know what
      happened after that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was too truthful,&rdquo; said Beetle. &ldquo;I always am. You see, he was under an
      impression, Padre, and I suppose I ought to have corrected that
      impression; but of course I couldn't be <i>quite</i> certain that his
      house wasn't given over to money-lendin', could I? I thought the
      house-prefects might know more about it than I did. They ought to. They're
      giddy palladiums of public schools.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They did, too&mdash;by the time they'd finished,&rdquo; said McTurk. &ldquo;As nice a
      pair of conscientious, well-meanin', upright, pure-souled boys as you'd
      ever want to meet, Padre. They turned the house upside down&mdash;Harrison
      and Craye&mdash;-with the best motives in the world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They said so. 'They said it very loud and clear. They went and shouted in
      our ear,'&rdquo; said Stalky.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My own private impression is that all three of you will infallibly be
      hanged,&rdquo; said the Reverend John.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, we didn't do anything,&rdquo; McTurk replied. &ldquo;It was all Mr. Prout. Did
      you ever read a book about Japanese wrestlers? My uncle&mdash;-he's in the
      Navy&mdash;gave me a beauty once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't try to change the subject, Turkey.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm not, sir. I'm givin' an illustration&mdash;same as a sermon. These
      wrestler-chaps have got sort sort of trick that lets the other chap do all
      the work. Than they give a little wriggle, and he upsets himself. It's
      called <i>shibbuwichee</i> or <i>tokonoma</i>, or somethin'. Mr. Prout's a
      <i>shibbuwicher</i>. It isn't our fault.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you suppose we went round corruptin' the minds of the fags?&rdquo; said
      Beetle. &ldquo;They haven't any, to begin with; and if they had, they're
      corrupted long ago. I've been a fag, Padre.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I fancied I knew the normal range of your iniquities; but if you
      take so much trouble to pile up circumstantial evidence against
      yourselves, you can't blame any one if&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We don't blame any one, Padre. We haven't said a word against Mr. Prout,
      have we?&rdquo; Stalky looked at the others. &ldquo;We love him. He hasn't a notion
      how we love him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;H'm! You dissemble your love very well. Have you ever thought who got you
      turned out of your study in the first place?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was Mr. Prout turned us out,&rdquo; said Stalky, with significance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I was that man. I didn't mean it; but some words of mine, I'm
      afraid, gave Mr. Prout the impression&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Number Five laughed aloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see it's just the same thing with you, Padre,&rdquo; said McTurk. &ldquo;He is
      quick to get an impression, ain't he? But you mustn't think we don't love
      him, 'cause we do. There isn't an ounce of vice about him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A double knock fell on the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Head to see Number Five study in his study at once,&rdquo; said the voice
      of Foxy, the school sergeant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whew!&rdquo; said the Reverend John. &ldquo;It seems to me that there is a great deal
      of trouble coming for some people.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My word! Mr. Prout's gone and told the Head,&rdquo; said Stalky. &ldquo;He's a moral
      double-ender. Not fair, luggin' the Head into a house-row.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should recommend a copy-book on a&mdash;h'm&mdash;safe and certain
      part,&rdquo; said the Reverend John disinterestedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Huh! He licks across the shoulders, an' it would slam like a beastly
      barn-door,&rdquo; said Beetle. &ldquo;Good-night, Padre. We're in for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Once more they stood in the presence of the Head&mdash;Belial, Mammon, and
      Lucifer. But they had to deal with a man more subtle than them all. Mr.
      Prout had talked to him, heavily and sadly, for half an hour; and the Head
      had seen all that was hidden from the house-master.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You've been bothering Mr. Prout,&rdquo; he said pensively. &ldquo;House-masters
      aren't here to be bothered by boys more than is necessary. I don't like
      being bothered by these things. You are bothering <i>me</i>. That is a
      very serious offense. You see it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, now, I purpose to bother you, on personal and private grounds,
      because you have broken into my time. You are much too big to lick, so I
      suppose I shall have to mark my displeasure in some other way. Say, a
      thousand lines apiece, a week's gating, and a few things of that kind.
      Much too big to lick, aren't you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no, sir,&rdquo; said Stalky cheerfully; for a week's gating in the summer
      term is serious.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ve-ry good. Then we will do what we can. I wish you wouldn't bother me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was a fair, sustained, equable stroke, with a little draw to it, but
      what they felt most was his unfairness in stopping to talk between
      executions. Thus: &ldquo;Among the&mdash;lower classes this would lay me open to
      a charge of&mdash;assault. You should be more grateful for your&mdash;privileges
      than you are. There is a limit&mdash;one finds it by experience, Beetle&mdash;beyond
      which it is never safe to pursue private vendettas, because&mdash;don't
      move&mdash;sooner or later one comes&mdash;into collision with the&mdash;higher
      authority, who has studied the animal. <i>Et ego</i>&mdash;McTurk, please&mdash;<i>in
      Arcadia vixi</i>. There's a certain flagrant injustice about this that
      ought to appeal to&mdash;your temperament. And that's all! You will tell
      your house-master that you have been formally caned by me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My word!&rdquo; said McTurk, wriggling his shoulder-blades all down the
      corridor. &ldquo;That was business! The Prooshan Bates has an infernal straight
      eye.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wasn't it wily of me to ask for the lickin',&rdquo; said Stalky, &ldquo;instead of
      those impots?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rot! We were in for it from the first. I knew the look of his old eye,&rdquo;
       said Beetle. &ldquo;I was within an inch of blubbing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I didn't exactly smile,&rdquo; Stalky confessed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let's go down to the lavatory and have a look at the damage. One of us
      can hold the glass and t'others can squint.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They proceeded on these lines for some ten minutes. The wales were very
      red and very level. There was not a penny to choose between any of them
      for thoroughness, efficiency, and a certain clarity of outline that stamps
      the work of the artist.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you doing down there?&rdquo; Mr. Prout was at the head of the lavatory
      stairs, attracted by the noise of splashing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We've only been caned by the Head, sir, and we're washing off the blood.
      The Head said we were to tell you. We were coming to report ourselves in a
      minute, sir. (<i>Sotto voce</i>.) That's a score for Heffy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, he deserves to score something, poor devil,&rdquo; said McTurk, putting
      on his shirt. &ldquo;We've sweated a stone and a half off him since we began.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But look here, why aren't we wrathy with the Head? He said it was a
      flagrant injustice. So it is!&rdquo; said Beetle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear man,&rdquo; said McTurk, and vouchsafed no further answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Stalky who laughed till he had to hold on by the edge of a basin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You <i>are</i> a funny ass! What's that for?&rdquo; said Beetle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm&mdash;I'm thinking of the flagrant injustice of it!&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      THE MORAL REFORMERS.
    </h2>
    <p>
      There was no disguising the defeat. The victory was to Prout, but they
      grudged it not. If he had broken the rules of the game by calling in the
      Head, they had had a good run for their money.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Reverend John sought the earliest opportunity of talking things over.
      Members of a bachelor Common-room, of a school where masters' studies are
      designedly dotted among studies and form-rooms, can, if they choose, see a
      great deal of their charges. Number Five had spent some cautious years in
      testing the Reverend John. He was emphatically a gentleman. He knocked at
      a study door before entering; he comported himself as a visitor and not a
      strayed lictor; he never prosed, and he never carried over into official
      life the confidences of idle hours. Prout was ever an unmitigated
      nuisance; King came solely as an avenger of blood; even little Hartopp,
      talking natural history, seldom forgot his office; but the Reverend John
      was a guest desired and beloved by Number Five.
    </p>
    <p>
      Behold him, then, in their only arm-chair, a bent briar between his teeth,
      chin down in three folds on his clerical collar, and blowing like an
      amiable whale, while Number Five discoursed of life as it appeared to
      them, and specially of that last interview with the Head&mdash;in the
      matter of usury.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One licking once a week would do you an immense amount of good,&rdquo; he said,
      twinkling and shaking all over; &ldquo;and, as you say, you were entirely in the
      right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ra-ather, Padre! We could have proved it if he'd let us talk,&rdquo; said
      Stalky; &ldquo;but he didn't. The Head's a downy bird.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He understands you perfectly. Ho! ho! Well, you worked hard enough for
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But he's awfully fair. He doesn't lick a chap in the morning an' preach
      at him in the afternoon,&rdquo; said Beetle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He can't; he ain't in Orders, thank goodness,&rdquo; said McTurk. Number Five
      held the very strongest views on clerical head-masters, and were ever
      ready to meet their pastor in argument.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Almost all other schools have clerical Heads,&rdquo; said the Reverend John
      gently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It isn't fair on the chaps,&rdquo; Stalky replied. &ldquo;Makes 'em sulky. Of course
      it's different with you, sir. You belong to the school&mdash;same as we
      do. I mean ordinary clergymen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I am a most ordinary clergyman; and Mr. Hartopp's in Orders, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ye&mdash;es, but he took 'em after he came to the Coll. We saw him go up
      for his exam. That's all right,&rdquo; said Beetle. &ldquo;But just think if the Head
      went and got ordained!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What would happen, Beetle?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, the Coll. 'ud go to pieces in a year, sir. There's no doubt o' that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How d'you know?&rdquo; The Reverend John was smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We've been here nearly six years now. There are precious few things about
      the Coll. we don't know,&rdquo; Stalky replied. &ldquo;Why, even you came the term
      after I did, sir. I remember your asking our names in form your first
      lesson. Mr. King, Mr. Prout, and the Head, of course, are the only masters
      senior to us&mdash;in that way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, we've changed a good deal&mdash;in Common-room.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Huh!&rdquo; said Beetle with a grunt. &ldquo;They came here, an' they went away to
      get married. Jolly good riddance, too!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doesn't our Beetle hold with matrimony?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Padre; don't make fun of me. I've met chaps in the holidays who've
      got married house-masters. It's perfectly awful! They have babies and
      teething and measles and all that sort of thing right bung <i>in</i> the
      school; and the masters' wives give tea-parties&mdash;tea-parties, Padre!&mdash;and
      ask the chaps to breakfast.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That don't matter so much,&rdquo; said Stalky. &ldquo;But the house-masters let their
      houses alone, and they leave everything to the prefects. Why, in one
      school, a chap told me, there were big baize doors and a passage about a
      mile long between the house and the master's house. They could do just
      what they pleased.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Satan rebuking sin with a vengeance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, larks are right enough; but you know what we mean, Padre. After a bit
      it gets worse an' worse. Then there's a big bust-up and a row that gets
      into the papers, and a lot of chaps are expelled, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Always the wrong un's; don't forget that. Have a cup of cocoa, Padre?&rdquo;
       said McTurk with the kettle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, thanks; I'm smoking. Always the wrong 'uns? Pro-ceed, my Stalky.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then&rdquo;&mdash;Stalky warmed to the work&mdash;&ldquo;everybody says, 'Who'd
      ha' thought it? Shockin' boys! Wicked little kids!' It all comes of havin'
      married house-masters, <i>I</i> think.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A Daniel come to judgment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it does,&rdquo; McTurk interrupted. &ldquo;I've met chaps in the holidays, an'
      they've told me the same thing. It looks awfully pretty for one's people
      to see&mdash;a nice separate house with a nice lady in charge, an' all
      that. But it isn't. It takes the house-masters off their work, and it
      gives the prefects a heap too much power, an'&mdash;an'&mdash;it rots up
      everything. You see, it isn't as if we were just an ordinary school. We
      take crammers' rejections as well as good little boys like Stalky. We've
      got to do that to make our name, of course, and we get 'em into Sandhurst
      somehow or other, don't we?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True, O Turk. Like a book thou talkest, Turkey.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so we want rather different masters, don't you think so, to other
      places? We aren't like the rest of the schools.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It leads to all sorts of bullyin', too, a chap told me,&rdquo; said Beetle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you <i>do</i> need most of a single man's time, I must say.&rdquo; The
      Reverend John considered his hosts critically. &ldquo;But do you never feel that
      the world&mdash;the Common-room&mdash;is too much with you sometimes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not exactly&mdash;in summer, anyhow.&rdquo; Stalky's eye roved contentedly to
      the window. &ldquo;Our bounds are pretty big, too, and they leave us to
      ourselves a good deal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For example, here am I sitting in your study, very much in your way, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed you aren't, Padre. Sit down. Don't go, sir. You know we're glad
      whenever you come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was no doubting the sincerity of the voices. The Reverend John
      flushed a little with pleasure and refilled his briar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And we generally know where the Common-room are,&rdquo; said Beetle
      triumphantly. &ldquo;Didn't you come through our lower dormitories last night
      after ten, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I went to smoke a pipe with your house-master. No, I didn't give him any
      impressions. I took a short cut through your dormitories.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I sniffed a whiff of 'baccy, this mornin'. Yours is stronger than Mr.
      Prout's. <i>I</i> knew,&rdquo; said Beetle, wagging his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good heavens!&rdquo; said the Reverend John absently. It was some years before
      Beetle perceived that this was rather a tribute to innocence than
      observation. The long, light, blindless dormitories, devoid of inner
      doors, were crossed at all hours of the night by masters visiting one
      another; for bachelors sit up later than married folk. Beetle had never
      dreamed that there might be a purpose in this steady policing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Talking about bullying,&rdquo; the Reverend John resumed, &ldquo;you all caught it
      pretty hot when you were fags, didn't you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, we must have been rather awful little beasts,&rdquo; said Beetle, looking
      serenely over the gulf between eleven and sixteen. &ldquo;My Hat, what bullies
      they were then&mdash;Fairburn, 'Gobby' Maunsell, and all that gang!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Member when 'Gobby' called us the Three Blind Mice, and we had to get up
      on the lockers and sing while he buzzed ink-pots at us?&rdquo; said Stalky.
      &ldquo;They <i>were</i> bullies if you like!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But there isn't any of it now,&rdquo; said McTurk soothingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's where you make a mistake. We're all inclined to say that
      everything is all right as long we aren't ourselves hurt. I sometimes
      wonder if it is extinct&mdash;bullying.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fags bully each other horrid; but the upper forms are supposed to be
      swottin' for exams. They've got something else to think about,&rdquo; said
      Beetle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why? What do you think?&rdquo; Stalky was watching the chaplain's face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have my doubts.&rdquo; Then, explosively, &ldquo;On my word, for three moderately
      intelligent boys you aren't very observant. I suppose you were too busy
      making things warm for your house-master to see what lay under your noses
      when you were in the form-rooms last week?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, sir? I&mdash;I swear we didn't see anything,&rdquo; said Beetle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I'd advise you to look. When a little chap is whimpering in a corner
      and wears his clothes like rags, and never does any work, and is
      notoriously the dirtiest little 'corridor-caution' in the Coll.,
      something's wrong somewhere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's Clewer,&rdquo; said McTurk under his breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Clewer. He comes to me for his French. It's his first term, and he's
      almost as complete a wreck as you were, Beetle. He's not naturally clever,
      but he has been hammered till he's nearly an idiot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no. They sham silly to get off more tickings,&rdquo; said Beetle. &ldquo;<i>I</i>
      know that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've never actually seen him knocked about,&rdquo; said the Reverend John.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The genuine article don't do that in public,&rdquo; said Beetle. &ldquo;Fairburn
      never touched me when any one was looking on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You needn't swagger about it, Beetle,&rdquo; said McTurk. &ldquo;We all caught it in
      our time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I got it worse than any one,&rdquo; said Beetle. &ldquo;If you want an authority
      on bullyin', Padre, come to me. Corkscrews&mdash;brush-drill keys&mdash;head-knucklin'&mdash;arm-twistin'&mdash;rockin'&mdash;Ag
      Ags&mdash;and all the rest of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. I do want you as an authority, or rather I want your authority to
      stop it&mdash;all of you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What about Abana and Pharpar, Padre&mdash;Harrison and Craye? They are
      Mr. Prout's pets,&rdquo; said McTurk a little bitterly. &ldquo;We aren't even
      sub-prefects.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've considered that, but on the other hand, since most bullying is mere
      thoughtlessness&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not one little bit of it, Padre,&rdquo; said McTurk. &ldquo;Bullies like bullyin'.
      They mean it. They think it up in lesson and practise it in the quarters.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind. If the thing goes up to the prefects it may make another
      house-row. You've had one already. Don't laugh. Listen to me. I ask you&mdash;my
      own Tenth Legion&mdash;to take the thing up quietly. I want little Clewer
      made to look fairly clean and decent&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Blowed if <i>I</i> wash him!&rdquo; whispered Stalky.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Decent and self-respecting. As for the other boy, whoever he is, you can
      use your influence&rdquo;&mdash;a purely secular light flickered in the
      chaplain's eye&mdash;&ldquo;in any way you please to&mdash;to dissuade him.
      That's all. I'll leave it to you. Good-night, <i>mes enfants</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what are we goin' to do?&rdquo; Number Five stared at each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Young Clewer would give his eyes for a place to be quiet in. <i>I</i>
      know that,&rdquo; said Beetle. &ldquo;If we made him a study-fag, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No!&rdquo; said McTurk firmly. &ldquo;He's a dirty little brute, and he'd mess up
      everything. Besides, we ain't goin' to have any beastly Erickin'. D'you
      want to walk about with your arm round his neck?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He'd clean out the jam-pots, anyhow; an' the burnt-porridge saucepan&mdash;it's
      filthy now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not good enough,&rdquo; said Stalky, bringing up both heels with a crash on the
      table. &ldquo;If we find the merry jester who's been bullyin' him an' make him
      happy, that'll be all right. Why didn't we spot him when we were in the
      form-rooms, though?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maybe a lot of fags have made a dead set at Clewer. They do that
      sometimes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then we'll have to kick the whole of the lower school in our house&mdash;on
      spec. Come on,&rdquo; said McTurk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Keep your hair on! We mustn't make a fuss about the biznai. Whoever it is
      he's kept quiet or we'd have seen him,&rdquo; said Stalky. &ldquo;We'll walk round and
      sniff about till we're sure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They drew the house form-rooms, accounting for every junior and senior
      against whom they had suspicions; investigated, at Beetle's suggestion,
      the lavatories and box-rooms, but without result. Everybody seemed to be
      present save Clewer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rum!&rdquo; said Stalky, pausing outside a study door. &ldquo;Golly!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A thin piping mixed with tears came muffled through the panels.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;'As beautiful Kitty one morning was tripping&mdash;'&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Louder, you young devil, or I'll buzz a book at you!&rdquo;
     </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;'With a pitcher of milk&mdash;'
  Oh, Campbell, <i>please</i> don't!
  'To the fair of&mdash;&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      A book crashed on something soft, and squeals arose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I never thought it was a study-chap, anyhow. That accounts for our
      not spotting him,&rdquo; said Beetle. &ldquo;Sefton and Campbell are rather hefty
      chaps to tackle. Besides, one can't go into their study like a form-room.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What swine!&rdquo; McTurk listened. &ldquo;Where's the fun of it? I suppose Clewer's
      faggin' for them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They aren't prefects. That's one good job,&rdquo; said Stalky, with his
      war-grin. &ldquo;Sefton and Campbell! Um! Campbell and Sefton! Ah! One of 'em's
      a crammer's pup.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The two were precocious hairy youths between seventeen and eighteen, sent
      to the school in despair by parents who hoped that six months' steady cram
      might, perhaps, jockey them into Sandhurst. Nominally they were in Mr.
      Prout's house; actually they were under the Head's eye; and since he was
      very careful never to promote strange new boys to prefectships, they
      considered they had a grievance against the school. Sefton had spent three
      months with a London crammer, and the tale of his adventures there lost
      nothing in the telling. Campbell, who had a fine taste in clothes and a
      fluent vocabulary, followed his lead in looking down loftily on the rest
      of the world. This was only their second term, and the school, used to
      what it profanely called &ldquo;crammers' pups,&rdquo; had treated them with rather
      galling reserve. But their whiskers&mdash;Sefton owned a real razor&mdash;and
      their mustaches were beyond question impressive.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall we go in an' dissuade 'em?&rdquo; McTurk asked. &ldquo;I've never had much to
      do with 'em, but I'll bet my hat Campbell's a funk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;o! That's <i>oratio directa</i>,&rdquo; said Stalky, shaking his head.
      &ldquo;I like <i>oratio obliqua</i>. 'Sides, where'd our moral influence be
      then? Think o' that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rot! What are you goin' to do?&rdquo; Beetle turned into Lower Number Nine
      form-room, next door to the study.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Me?&rdquo; The lights of war flickered over Stalky's face. &ldquo;Oh, I want to jape
      with 'em. Shut up a bit!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He drove his hands into his pockets and stared out of window at the sea,
      whistling between his teeth. Then a foot tapped the floor; one shoulder
      lifted; he wheeled, and began the short quick double-shuffle&mdash;the
      war-dance of Stalky in meditation. Thrice he crossed the empty form-room,
      with compressed lips and expanded nostrils, swaying to the quick-step.
      Then he halted before the dumb Beetle and softly knuckled his head, Beetle
      bowing to the strokes. McTurk nursed one knee and rocked to and fro. They
      could hear Clewer howling as though his heart would break.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Beetle is the sacrifice,&rdquo; Stalky said at last, &ldquo;I'm sorry for you,
      Beetle. 'Member Galton's 'Art of Travel' [one of the forms had been
      studying that pleasant work] an' the kid whose bleatin' excited the
      tiger?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, curse!&rdquo; said Beetle uneasily. It was not his first season as a
      sacrifice. &ldquo;Can't you get on without me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Fraid not, Beetle, dear. You've got to be bullied by Turkey an' me. The
      more you howl, o' course, the better it'll be. Turkey, go an' covet a
      stump and a box-rope from somewhere. We'll tie him up for a kill&mdash;<i>a'
      la</i> Galton. 'Member when 'Molly' Fairburn made us cock-fight with our
      shoes off, an' tied up our knees?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But that hurt like sin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Course it did. What a clever chap you are, Beetle! Turkey'll knock you
      all over the place. 'Member we've had a big row all round, an' I've
      trapped you into doin' this. Lend us your wipe.&rdquo; Beetle was trussed for
      cock-fighting; but, in addition to the transverse stump between elbow and
      knee, His knees were bound with a box-rope. In this posture, at a push
      from Stalky he rolled over sideways, covering himself with dust.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ruffle his hair, Turkey. Now you get down, too. 'The bleatin' of the kid
      excites the tiger.' You two are in such a sweatin' wax with me that you
      only curse. 'Member that. I'll tickle you up with a stump. You'll have to
      blub, Beetle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Right O! I'll work up to it in half a shake,&rdquo; said Beetle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now begin&mdash;and remember the bleatin' o' the kid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shut up, you brutes! Let me up! You've nearly cut my knees off. Oh, you
      <i>are</i> beastly cads! <i>Do</i> shut up. 'Tisn't a joke!&rdquo; Beetle's
      protest was, in tone, a work of art.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give it to him, Turkey! Kick him! Roll him over! Kill him! Don't funk,
      Beetle, you brute. Kick him again, Turkey.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's not blubbin' really. Roll up, Beetle, or I'll kick you into the
      fender,&rdquo; roared McTurk. They made a hideous noise among them, and the bait
      allured their quarry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hullo! What's the giddy jest?&rdquo; Sefton and Campbell entered to find Beetle
      on his side, his head against the fender, weeping copiously, while McTurk
      prodded him in the back with his toes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's only Beetle,&rdquo; Stalky explained. &ldquo;He's shammin' hurt. I can't get
      Turkey to go for him properly.&rdquo; Sefton promptly kicked both boys, and his
      face lighted. &ldquo;All right, I'll attend to 'em. Get up an' cock-fight, you
      two. Give me the stump. I'll tickle 'em. Here's a giddy jest! Come on,
      Campbell. Let's cook 'em.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then McTurk turned on Stalky and called him very evil names.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You said you were goin' to cock-fight too, Stalky. Come on!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;More ass you for believin' me, then!&rdquo; shrieked Stalky.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you chaps had a row?&rdquo; said Campbell. &ldquo;Row?&rdquo; said Stalky. &ldquo;Huh! I'm
      only educatin' them. D'you know anythin' about cock-fighting, Seffy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do I know? Why, at Maclagan's, where I was crammin' in town, we used to
      cock-fight in his drawing-room, and little Maclagan daren't say anything.
      But we were just the same as men there, of course. Do I know? <i>I</i>'ll
      show you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can't I get up?&rdquo; moaned Beetle, as Stalky sat on his shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't jaw, you fat piffler. You're going to fight Seffy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He'll slay me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, lug 'em into our study,&rdquo; said Campbell. &ldquo;It's nice an' quiet in
      there. I'll cock-fight Turkey. This is an improvement on young Clewer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Right O! I move it's shoes-off for them an' shoes-on for us,&rdquo; said Sefton
      joyously, and the two were flung down on the study floor. Stalky rolled
      them behind an arm-chair. &ldquo;Now I'll tie you two up an' direct the
      bull-fight. Golly, what wrists you have, Seffy. They're too thick for a
      wipe; got a box-rope?&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lots in the corner,&rdquo; Sefton replied. &ldquo;Hurry up! Stop blubbin', you brute,
      Beetle. We're goin' to have a giddy campaign. Losers have to sing for the
      winners&mdash;sing odes in honor of the conqueror. You call yourself a
      beastly poet, don't you, Beetle? I'll poet you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He wriggled into position by Campbell's side. Swiftly and scientifically
      the stumps were thrust through the natural crooks, and the wrists tied
      with well-stretched box-ropes to an accompaniment of insults from McTurk,
      bound, betrayed, and voluble behind the chair. Stalky set away Campbell
      and Sefton, and strode over to his allies, locking the door on the way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And that's all right,&rdquo; said he in a changed voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What the devil&mdash;?&rdquo; Sefton began. Beetle's false tears had ceased;
      McTurk, smiling, was on his feet. Together they bound the knees and ankles
      of the enemy even more straitly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stalky took the arm-chair and contemplated the scene with his blandest
      smile. A man trussed for cock-fighting is, perhaps, the most helpless
      thing in the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'The bleatin' of the kid excites the tiger.' Oh, you frabjous asses!&rdquo; He
      lay back and laughed till he could no more. The victims took in the
      situation but slowly. &ldquo;We'll give you the finest lickin' you ever had in
      your young lives when we get up!&rdquo; thundered Sefton from the floor. &ldquo;You'll
      laugh the other side of your mouth before you've done. What the deuce
      d'you mean by this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'll see in two shakes,&rdquo; said McTurk. &ldquo;Don't swear like that. What we
      want to know is, why you two hulkin' swine have been bullyin' Clewer?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's none of your business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did you bully Clewer for?&rdquo; The question was repeated with maddening
      iteration by each in turn. They knew their work.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because we jolly well chose!&rdquo; was the answer at last. &ldquo;Let's get up.&rdquo;
       Even then they could not realize the game.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, now we're goin' to bully you because we jolly well choose. We're
      goin' to be just as fair to you as you were to Clewer. He couldn't do
      anything against you. You can't do anything to us. Odd, ain't it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can't we? You wait an' see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said Beetle reflectively, &ldquo;that shows you've never been properly
      jested with. A public lickin' ain't in it with a gentle jape. Bet a bob
      you'll weep an' promise anything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here, young Beetle, we'll half kill you when we get up. I'll promise
      you that, at any rate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're going to be half killed first, though. Did you give Clewer
      Head-knuckles?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you give Clewer Head-knuckles?&rdquo; McTurk echoed. At the twentieth
      repetition&mdash;no boy can stand the torture of one unvarying query,
      which is the essence of bullying&mdash;came confession.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We did, confound you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you'll be knuckled;&rdquo; and knuckled they were, according to ancient
      experience. Head-knuckling is no trifle; &ldquo;Molly&rdquo; Fairburn of the old days
      could not have done better.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you give Clewer Brush-drill?&rdquo; This time the question was answered
      sooner, and Brush-drill was dealt out for the space of five minutes by
      Stalky's watch. They could not even writhe in their bonds. No brush is
      employed in Brush-drill.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you give Clewer the Key?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; we didn't. I swear we didn't!&rdquo; from Campbell, rolling in agony.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then we'll give it to you, so you can see what it would be like if you
      had.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The torture of the Key&mdash;which has no key at all&mdash;hurts
      excessively. They endured several minutes of it, and their language
      necessitated the gag.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you give Clewer Corkscrews?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Oh, curse your silly souls! Let us alone, you cads.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They were corkscrewed, and the torture of the Corkscrew&mdash;this has
      nothing to do with corkscrews&mdash;is keener than the torture of the Key.
    </p>
    <p>
      The method and silence of the attacks was breaking their nerves. Between
      each new torture came the pitiless, dazing rain of questions, and when
      they did not answer to the point, Isabella-colored handkerchiefs were
      thrust into their mouths.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now are those all the things you did to Clewer? Take out the gag, Turkey,
      and let 'em answer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I swear that was all. Oh, you're killing us, Stalky!&rdquo; cried
      Campbell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pre-cisely what Clewer said to you. I heard him. Now we're goin' to show
      you what real bullyin' is. 'What I don't like about you, Sefton, is, you
      come to the Coll. with your stick-up collars an' patent-leather boots, an'
      you think you can teach us something about bullying. Do you think you can
      teach us anything about bullying? Take out the gag and let him answer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No!&rdquo;&mdash;ferociously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He says no. Rock him to sleep. Campbell can watch.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It needs three boys and two boxing-gloves to rock a boy to sleep. Again
      the operation has nothing to do with its name. Sefton was &ldquo;rocked&rdquo; till
      his eyes set in his head and he gasped and crowed for breath, sick and
      dizzy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My Aunt!&rdquo; said Campbell, appalled, from his corner, and turned white.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Put him away,&rdquo; said Stalky. &ldquo;Bring on Campbell. Now this <i>is</i>
      bullyin'. Oh, I forgot! I say, Campbell, what did you bully Clewer for?
      Take out his gag and let him answer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I don't know. Oh, let me off! I swear I'll make it <i>pax</i>.
      Don't 'rock' me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'The bleatin' of the kid excites the tiger.' He says he don't know. Set
      him up, Beetle. Give me the glove an' put in the gag.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In silence Campbell was &ldquo;rocked&rdquo; sixty-four times.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe I'm goin' to die!&rdquo; he gasped. &ldquo;He says he is goin' to die. Put
      him away. Now, Sefton! Oh, I forgot! Sefton, what did you bully Clewer
      for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The answer is unprintable; but it brought not the faintest flush to
      Stalky's downy cheek.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Make him an Ag Ag, Turkey!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And an Ag Ag was he made, forthwith. The hard-bought experience of nearly
      eighteen years was at his disposal, but he did not seem to appreciate it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He says we are sweeps. Put him away! Now, Campbell! Oh, I forgot! I say,
      Campbell, what did you bully Clewer for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then came the tears&mdash;scalding tears; appeals for mercy and abject
      promises of peace. Let them cease the tortures and Campbell would never
      lift hand against them. The questions began again&mdash;to an
      accompaniment of small persuasions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You seem hurt, Campbell. Are you hurt?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Awfully!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He says he is hurt. Are you broke?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes! I swear I am. Oh, stop!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He says he is broke. Are you humble?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He says he is humble. Are you devilish humble?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He says he is devilish humble. Will you bully Clewer any more?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. No&mdash;ooh!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He says he won't bully Clewer. Or any one else?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. I swear I won't.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or any one else. What about that lickin' you and Sefton were goin' to
      give us?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I won't! I won't! I swear I won't!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He says he won't lick us. Do you esteem yourself to know anything about
      bullyin'?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I don't!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He says he doesn't know anything about bullyin'. Haven't we taught you a
      lot?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;yes!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He says we've taught him a lot. Aren't you grateful?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He says he is grateful. Put him away. Oh, I forgot! I say, Campbell, what
      did you bully Clewer for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He wept anew; his nerves being raw. &ldquo;Because I was a bully. I suppose
      that's what you want me to say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He says he is a bully. Right he is. Put him in the corner. No more japes
      for Campbell. Now, Sefton!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You devils! You young devils!&rdquo; This and much more as Sefton was punted
      across the carpet by skilful knees.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'The bleatin' of the kid excites the tiger.' We're goin' to make you
      beautiful. Where does he keep his shaving things? [Campbell told.] Beetle,
      get some water. Turkey, make the lather. We're goin' to shave you, Seffy,
      so you'd better lie jolly still, or you'll get cut. I've never shaved any
      one before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't! Oh, don't! Please don't!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gettin' polite, eh? I'm only goin' to take off one ducky little whisker&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll&mdash;I'll make it <i>pax</i>, if you don't. I swear I'll let you
      off your lickin' when I get up!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>And</i> half that mustache we're so proud of. He says he'll let us off
      our lickin'. Isn't he kind?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      McTurk laughed into the nickel-plated shaving-cup, and settled Sefton's
      head between Stalky's vise-like knees.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hold on a shake,&rdquo; said Beetle, &ldquo;you can't shave long hairs. You've got to
      cut all that mustache short first, an' then scrape him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I'm not goin' to hunt about for scissors. Won't a match do? Chuck
      us the match-box. He <i>is</i> a hog, you know; we might as well singe
      him. Lie still!&rdquo; He lit a vesta, but checked his hand. &ldquo;I only want to
      take off half, though.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's all right.&rdquo; Beetle waved the brush. &ldquo;I'll lather up to the middle&mdash;see?
      and you can burn off the rest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The thin-haired first mustache of youth fluffed off in flame to the
      lather-line in the centre of the lip, and Stalky rubbed away the burnt
      stumpage with his thumb. It was not a very gentle shave, but it abundantly
      accomplished its purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now the whisker on the other side. Turn him over!&rdquo; Between match and
      razor this, too, was removed. &ldquo;Give him his shaving-glass. Take the gag
      out. I want to hear what he'll say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But there were no words. Sefton gazed at the lop-sided wreck in horror and
      despair. Two fat tears rolled down his cheek.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I forgot! I say, Sefton, what did you bully Clewer for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Leave me alone! Oh, you infernal bullies, leave me alone! Haven't I had
      enough?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He says we must leave him alone,&rdquo; said McTurk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He says we are bullies, an' we haven't even begun yet,&rdquo; said Beetle.
      &ldquo;You're ungrateful, Seffy. Golly! You do look an atrocity and a half!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He says he has had enough,&rdquo; said Stalky. &ldquo;He errs!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, to work, to work!&rdquo; chanted McTurk, waving a stump. &ldquo;Come on, my
      giddy Narcissus. Don't fall in love with your own reflection!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, let him off,&rdquo; said Campbell from his corner; &ldquo;he's blubbing, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sefton cried like a twelve-year-old with pain, shame, wounded vanity, and
      utter helplessness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'll make it <i>pax</i>, Sefton, won't you? You can't stand up to those
      young devils&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't be rude, Campbell, de-ah,&rdquo; said McTurk, &ldquo;or you'll catch it again!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You <i>are</i> devils, you know,&rdquo; said Campbell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What? for a little bullyin'&mdash;same as you've been givin' Clewer! How
      long have you been jestin' with him?&rdquo; said Stalky. &ldquo;All this term?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We didn't always knock him about, though!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You did when you could catch him,&rdquo; said Beetle, cross-legged on the
      floor, dropping a stump from time to time across Sefton's instep. &ldquo;Don't I
      know it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;perhaps we did.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you went out of your way to catch him? Don't I know it! Because he
      was an awful little beast, eh? Don't I know it! Now, you see, <i>you</i>'re
      awful beasts, and you're gettin' what he got&mdash;for bein' a beast. Just
      because we choose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We never really bullied him&mdash;like you've done us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yah!&rdquo; said Beetle. &ldquo;They never really bully&mdash;'Molly' Fairburn
      didn't. Only knock 'em about a little bit. That's what they say. Only kick
      their souls out of 'em, and they go and blub in the box-rooms. Shove their
      heads into the ulsters an' blub. Write home three times a day&mdash;yes,
      you brute, I've done that&mdash;askin' to be taken away. You've never been
      bullied properly, Campbell I'm sorry you made <i>pax</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm not!&rdquo; said Campbell, who was a humorist in a way. &ldquo;Look out, you're
      slaying Sefton!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In his excitement Beetle had used the stump unreflectingly, and Sefton was
      now shouting for mercy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An' you!&rdquo; he cried, wheeling where he sat. &ldquo;You've never been bullied,
      either. Where were you before you came here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I had a tutor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yah! You would. You never blubbed in your life. But you're blubbin' now,
      by gum. Aren't you blubbin'?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can't you see, you blind beast?&rdquo; Sefton fell over sideways, tear-tracks
      furrowing the dried lather. Crack came the cricket-stump on the curved
      latter-end of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Blind, am I,&rdquo; said Beetle, &ldquo;and a beast? Shut up, Stalky. I'm goin' to
      jape a bit with our friend, <i>a' la</i> 'Molly' Fairburn. <i>I</i> think
      I can see. Can't I see, Sefton?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The point is well taken,&rdquo; said McTurk, watching the strap at work. &ldquo;You'd
      better say that he sees, Seffy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You do&mdash;you can! I swear you do!&rdquo; yelled Sefton, for strong
      arguments were coercing him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aren't my eyes lovely?&rdquo; The stump rose and fell steadily throughout this
      catechism.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A gentle hazel, aren't they?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;oh, yes!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a liar you are! They're sky-blue. Ain't they sky-blue?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;oh, yes!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't know your mind from one minute to another. You must learn&mdash;you
      must learn.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a bait you're in!&rdquo; said Stalky. &ldquo;Keep your hair on, Beetle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've had it done to me,&rdquo; said Beetle. &ldquo;Now&mdash;about my being a beast.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Pax</i>&mdash;oh, <i>pax</i>!&rdquo; cried Sefton; &ldquo;make it <i>pax</i>. I'll
      give up! Let me off! I'm broke! I can't stand it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ugh! Just when we were gettin' our hand in!&rdquo; grunted McTurk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They didn't let Clewer off, I'll swear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Confess&mdash;apologize&mdash;quick!&rdquo; said Stalky.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the floor Sefton made unconditional surrender, more abjectly even
      than Campbell He would never touch any one again. He would go softly all
      the days of his life.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We've got to take it, I suppose?&rdquo; said Stalky. &ldquo;All right, Sefton. You're
      broke? Very good. Shut up, Beetle! But before we let you up, you an'
      Campbell will kindly oblige us with 'Kitty of Coleraine'&mdash;<i>a' la</i>
      Clewer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's not fair,&rdquo; said Campbell; &ldquo;we've surrendered.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Course you have. Now you're goin' to do what we tell you&mdash;same as
      Clewer would. If you hadn't surrendered you'd ha' been really bullied.
      Havin' surrendered&mdash;do you follow, Seffy?&mdash;you sing odes in
      honor of the conquerors. Hurry up!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They dropped into chairs luxuriously. Campbell and Sefton looked at each
      other, and, neither taking comfort from that view, struck up &ldquo;Kitty of
      Coleraine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Vile bad,&rdquo; said Stalky, as the miserable wailing ended. &ldquo;If you hadn't
      surrendered it would have been our painful duty to buzz books at you for
      singin' out o' tune. Now then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He freed them from their bonds, but for several minutes they could not
      rise. Campbell was first on his feet, smiling uneasily. Sefton staggered
      to the table, buried his head in his arms, and shook with sobs. There was
      no shadow of fight in either&mdash;only amazement, distress, and shame.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ca&mdash;can't he shave clean before tea, please?&rdquo; said Campbell. &ldquo;It's
      ten minutes to bell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Stalky shook his head. He meant to escort the half-shaved one to the meal.
    </p>
    <p>
      McTurk yawned in his chair and Beetle mopped his face. They were all
      dripping with excitement and exertion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I knew anything about it, I swear I'd give you a moral lecture,&rdquo; said
      Stalky severely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't jaw; they've surrendered,&rdquo; said McTurk. &ldquo;This moral suasion biznai
      takes it out of a chap.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't you see how gentle we've been? We might have called Clewer in to
      look at you,&rdquo; said Stalky. &ldquo;'The bleatin' of the tiger excites the kid.'
      But we didn't. We've only got to tell a few chaps in Coll. about this and
      you'd be hooted all over the shop. Your life wouldn't be worth havin'. But
      we aren't goin' to do that, either. We're strictly moral suasers,
      Campbell; so, unless you or Seffy split about this, no one will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I swear you're a brick,&rdquo; said Campbell. &ldquo;I suppose I was rather a brute
      to Clewer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It looked like it,&rdquo; said Stalky. &ldquo;But I don't think Seffy need come into
      hall with cock-eye whiskers. Horrid bad for the fags if they saw him. He
      can shave. Ain't you grateful, Sefton?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The head did not lift. Sefton was deeply asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's rummy,&rdquo; said McTurk, as a snore mixed with a sob. &ldquo;'Cheek, <i>I</i>
      think; or else he's shammin'.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, 'tisn't,&rdquo; said Beetle. &ldquo;'When 'Molly' Fairburn had attended to me for
      an hour or so I used to go bung off to sleep on a form sometimes. Poor
      devil! But he called me a beastly poet, though.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, come on.&rdquo; Stalky lowered his voice. &ldquo;Good-by, Campbell. 'Member, if
      you don't talk, nobody will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There should have been a war-dance, but that all three were so utterly
      tired that they almost went to sleep above the tea-cups in their study,
      and slept till prep.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A most extraordinary letter. Are all parents incurably mad? What do you
      make of it?&rdquo; said the Head, handing a closely written eight pages to the
      Reverend John.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'The only son of his mother, and she a widow.' That is the least
      reasonable sort.&rdquo; The chaplain read with pursed lips. &ldquo;If half those
      charges are true he should be in the sick-house; whereas he is
      disgustingly well. Certainly he has shaved. I noticed that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Under compulsion, as his mother points out. How delicious! How salutary!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You haven't to answer her. It isn't often I don't know what has happened
      in the school; but this is beyond me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you asked me I should say seek not to propitiate. When one is forced
      to take crammers' pups&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was perfectly well at extra-tuition&mdash;with me&mdash;this morning,&rdquo;
       said the Head, absently. &ldquo;Unusually well behaved, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&mdash;they either educate the school, or the school, as in this case,
      educates them. I prefer our own methods,&rdquo; the chaplain concluded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You think it was that?&rdquo; A lift of the Head's eye-brow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm sure of it! And nothing excuses his trying to give the College a bad
      name.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's the line I mean to take with him,&rdquo; the Head answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Augurs winked.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few days later the Reverend John called on Number Five. &ldquo;Why haven't we
      seen you before, Padre?&rdquo; said they.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've been watching times and seasons and events and men&mdash;and boys,&rdquo;
       he replied. &ldquo;I am pleased with my Tenth Legion. I make them my
      compliments. Clewer was throwing ink-balls in form this morning, instead
      of doing his work. He is now doing fifty lines for&mdash;unheard-of
      audacity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can't blame us, sir,&rdquo; said Beetle. &ldquo;You told us to remove the&mdash;er&mdash;pressure.
      That's the worst of a fag.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've known boys five years his senior throw ink-balls, Beetle. To such an
      one have I given two hundred lines&mdash;not so long ago. And now I come
      to think of it, were those lines ever shown up?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Were they, Turkey?' said Beetle unblushingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't you think Clewer looks a little cleaner, Padre?&rdquo; Stalky
      interrupted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We're no end of moral reformers,&rdquo; said McTurk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was all Stalky, but it was a lark,&rdquo; said Beetle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have noticed the moral reform in several quarters. Didn't I tell you
      you had more influence than any boys in the Coll. if you cared to use it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's a trifle exhaustin' to use frequent&mdash;our kind of moral suasion.
      Besides, you see, it only makes Clewer cheeky.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wasn't thinking of Clewer; I was thinking of&mdash;the other people,
      Stalky.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, we didn't bother much about the other people,&rdquo; said McTurk. &ldquo;Did we?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But <i>I</i> did&mdash;from the beginning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you knew, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A downward puff of smoke. &ldquo;Boys educate each other, they say, more than we
      can or dare. If I had used one half of the moral suasion you may or may
      not have employed&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With the best motives in the world. Don't forget our pious motives,
      Padre,&rdquo; said McTurk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose I should be now languishing in Bideford jail, shouldn't I?
      Well, to quote the Head, in a little business which we have agreed to
      forget, that strikes me as flagrant injustice... What are you laughing at,
      you young sinners? Isn't it true? I will not stay to be shouted at. What I
      looked into this den of iniquity for was to find out if any one cared to
      come down for a bathe off the Ridge. But I see you won't.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Won't we, though! Half a shake, Padre Sahib, till we get our towels, and
      <i>nous sommes avec vous</i>!&rdquo;

    <h2>
      A LITTLE PREP.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Easter term was but a month old when Stettson major, a day-boy, contracted
      diphtheria, and the Head was very angry. He decreed a new and narrower set
      of bounds&mdash;the infection had been traced to an out-lying farmhouse&mdash;urged
      the prefects severely to lick all trespassers, and promised extra
      attentions from his own hand. There were no words bad enough for Stettson
      major, quarantined at his mother's house, who had lowered the
      school-average of health. This he said in the gymnasium after prayers.
      Then he wrote some two hundred letters to as many anxious parents and
      guardians, and bade the school carry on. The trouble did not spread, but,
      one night, a dog-cart drove to the Head's door, and in the morning the
      Head had gone, leaving all things in charge of Mr. King, senior
      house-master. The Head often ran up to town, where the school devoutly
      believed he bribed officials for early proofs of the Army Examination
      papers; but this absence was unusually prolonged.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Downy old bird!&rdquo; said Stalky to the allies one wet afternoon in the
      study. &ldquo;He must have gone on a bend and been locked up under a false
      name.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What for?&rdquo; Beetle entered joyously into the libel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forty shillin's or a month for hackin' the chucker-out of the Pavvy on
      the shins. Bates always has a spree when he goes to town. Wish he was
      back, though. I'm about sick o' King's 'whips an' scorpions' an' lectures
      on public-school spirit&mdash;yah!&mdash;and scholarship!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Crass an' materialized brutality of the middle-classes&mdash;readin'
      solely for marks. Not a scholar in the whole school,'&rdquo; McTurk quoted,
      pensively boring holes in the mantel-piece with a hot poker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's rather a sickly way of spending an afternoon. Stinks too. Let's
      come out an' smoke. Here's a treat.&rdquo; Stalky held up a long Indian cheroot.
      &ldquo;'Bagged it from my pater last holidays. I'm a bit shy of it though; it's
      heftier than a pipe. We'll smoke it palaver-fashion. Hand it round, eh?
      Let's lie up behind the old harrow on the Monkey-farm Road.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Out of bounds. Bounds beastly strict these days, too. Besides, we shall
      cat.&rdquo; Beetle sniffed the cheroot critically. &ldquo;It's a regular Pomposo
      Stinkadore.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can; I shan't. What d'you say, Turkey?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, may's well, I s'pose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Chuck on your cap, then. It's two to one. Beetle, out you come!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They saw a group of boys by the notice-board in the corridor; little Foxy,
      the school sergeant, among them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;More bounds, I expect,&rdquo; said Stalky. &ldquo;Hullo, Foxibus, who are you in
      mournin' for?&rdquo; There was a broad band of crape round Foxy's arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was in my old regiment,&rdquo; said Foxy, jerking his head towards the
      notices, where a newspaper cutting was thumb-tacked between call-over
      lists.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By gum!&rdquo; quoth Stalky, uncovering as he read. &ldquo;It's old Duncan&mdash;Fat-Sow
      Duncan&mdash;killed on duty at something or other Kotal. '<i>Rallyin' his
      men with conspicuous gallantry.</i>' He would, of course. '<i>The body was
      recovered</i>.' That's all right. They cut 'em up sometimes, don't they,
      Foxy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Horrid,&rdquo; said the sergeant briefly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor old Fat-Sow! I was a fag when he left. How many does that make to
      us, Foxy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Duncan, he is the ninth. He come here when he was no bigger than
      little Grey tertius. My old regiment, too. Yiss, nine to us, Mr. Corkran,
      up to date.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The boys went out into the wet, walking swiftly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wonder how it feels&mdash;to be shot and all that,&rdquo; said Stalky, as they
      splashed down a lane. &ldquo;Where did it happen, Beetle?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, out in India somewhere. We're always rowin' there. But look here,
      Stalky, what <i>is</i> the good o' sittin' under a hedge an' cattin'? It's
      be-eastly cold. It's be-eastly wet, and we'll be collared as sure as a
      gun.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shut up! Did you ever know your Uncle Stalky get you into a mess yet?&rdquo;
       Like many other leaders, Stalky did not dwell on past defeats. They pushed
      through a dripping hedge, landed among water-logged clods, and sat down on
      a rust-coated harrow. The cheroot burned with sputterings of saltpetre.
      They smoked it gingerly, each passing to the other between closed
      forefinger and thumb.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good job we hadn't one apiece, ain't it?&rdquo; said Stalky, shivering through
      set teeth. To prove his words he immediately laid all before them, and
      they followed his example...
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I told you,&rdquo; moaned Beetle, sweating clammy drops. &ldquo;Oh, Stalky, you are a
      fool!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Je cat</i>, <i>tu cat</i>, <i>il cat</i>. <i>Nous cattons</i>!&rdquo; McTurk
      handed up his contribution and lay hopelessly on the cold iron.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Something's wrong with the beastly thing. I say, Beetle, have you been
      droppin' ink on it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Beetle was in no case to answer. Limp and empty, they sprawled across
      the harrow, the rust marking their ulsters in red squares and the
      abandoned cheroot-end reeking under their very cold noses. Then&mdash;they
      had heard nothing&mdash;the Head himself stood before them&mdash;the Head
      who should have been in town bribing examiners&mdash;the Head
      fantastically attired in old tweeds and a deer-stalker!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; he said, fingering his mustache. &ldquo;Very good. I might have guessed
      who it was. You will go back to the College and give my compliments to Mr.
      King and ask him to give you an extra-special licking. You will then do me
      five hundred lines. I shall be back to-morrow. Five hundred lines by five
      o'clock to-morrow. You are also gated for a week. This is not exactly the
      time for breaking bounds. Extra-special, please.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He disappeared over the hedge as lightly as he had come. There was a
      murmur of women's voices in the deep lane.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you Prooshan brute!&rdquo; said McTurk as the voices died away. &ldquo;Stalky,
      it's all your silly fault.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kill him! Kill him!&rdquo; gasped Beetle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ca-an't. I'm going to cat again... I don't mind that, but King'll gloat
      over us horrid. Extra-special, ooh!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Stalky made no answer&mdash;not even a soft one. They went to College and
      received that for which they had been sent. King enjoyed himself most
      thoroughly, for by virtue of their seniority the boys were exempt from his
      hand, save under special order. Luckily, he was no expert in the gentle
      art.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Strange, how desire doth outrun performance,'&rdquo; said Beetle irreverently,
      quoting from some Shakespeare play that they were cramming that term. They
      regained their study and settled down to the imposition.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're quite right, Beetle.&rdquo; Stalky spoke in silky and propitiating
      tones. &ldquo;Now, if the Head had sent us up to a prefect, we'd have got
      something to remember!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; McTurk began with cold venom, &ldquo;we aren't goin' to row you
      about this business, because it's too bad for a row; but we want you to
      understand you're jolly well excommunicated, Stalky. You're a plain ass.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How was I to know that the Head 'ud collar us? What was he doin' in those
      ghastly clothes, too?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't try to raise a side-issue,&rdquo; Beetle grunted severely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it was all Stettson major's fault. If he hadn't gone an' got
      diphtheria 'twouldn't have happened. But don't you think it rather rummy&mdash;the
      Head droppin' on us that way?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shut up! You're dead!&rdquo; said Beetle. &ldquo;We've chopped your spurs off your
      beastly heels. We've cocked your shield upside down and&mdash;-and I don't
      think you ought to be allowed to brew for a month.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, stop jawin' at me. I want&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop? Why&mdash;why, we're gated for a week.&rdquo; McTurk almost howled as the
      agony of the situation overcame him. &ldquo;A lickin' from King, five hundred
      lines, <i>and</i> a gatin'. D'you expect us to kiss you, Stalky, you
      beast?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Drop rottin' for a minute. I want to find out about the Head bein' where
      he was.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you have. You found him quite well and fit. Found him makin' love
      to Stettson major's mother. That was her in the lane&mdash;I heard her.
      And so we were ordered a lickin' before a day-boy's mother. Bony old
      widow, too,&rdquo; said McTurk. &ldquo;Anything else you'd like to find out?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't care. I swear I'll get even with him some day,&rdquo; Stalky growled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Looks like it,&rdquo; said McTurk. &ldquo;Extra-special, week's gatin' and five
      hundred... and now you're goin' to row about it! Help scrag him, Beetle!&rdquo;
       Stalky had thrown his Virgil at them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Head returned next day without explanation, to find the lines waiting
      for him and the school a little relaxed under Mr. King's viceroyalty. Mr.
      King had been talking at and round and over the boys' heads, in a lofty
      and promiscuous style, of public-school spirit and the traditions of
      ancient seats; for he always improved an occasion. Beyond waking in two
      hundred and fifty young hearts a lively hatred of all other foundations,
      he accomplished little&mdash;so little, indeed, that when, two days after
      the Head's return, he chanced to come across Stalky &amp; Co., gated but
      ever resourceful, playing marbles in the corridor, he said that he was not
      surprised&mdash;not in the least surprised. This was what he had expected
      from persons of their <i>morale</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But there isn't any rule against marbles, sir. Very interestin' game,&rdquo;
       said Beetle, his knees white with chalk and dust. Then he received two
      hundred lines for insolence, besides an order to go to the nearest prefect
      for judgment and slaughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is what happened behind the closed doors of Flint's study, and Flint
      was then Head of the Games:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I say, Flint. King has sent me to you for playin' marbles in the
      corridor an' shoutin' 'alley tor' an' 'knuckle down.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What does he suppose I have to do with that?&rdquo; was the answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dunno. Well?&rdquo; Beetle grinned wickedly. &ldquo;What am I to tell him? He's
      rather wrathy about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If the Head chooses to put a notice in the corridor forbiddin' marbles, I
      can do something; but I can't move on a house-master's report. He knows
      that as well as I do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The sense of this oracle Beetle conveyed, all unsweetened, to King, who
      hastened to interview Flint.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now Flint had been seven and a half years at the College, counting six
      months with a London crammer, from whose roof he had returned, homesick,
      to the Head for the final Army polish. There were four or five other
      seniors who had gone through much the same mill, not to mention boys,
      rejected by other establishments on account of a certain overwhelmingness,
      whom the Head had wrought into very fair shape. It was not a Sixth to be
      handled without gloves, as King found.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Am I to understand it is your intention to allow board-school games under
      your study windows, Flint? If so, I can only say&mdash;&rdquo; He said much, and
      Flint listened politely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, sir, if the Head sees fit to call a prefects' meeting we are bound
      to take the matter up. But the tradition of the school is that the
      prefects can't move in any matter affecting the whole school without the
      Head's direct order.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Much more was then delivered, both sides a little losing their temper.
    </p>
    <p>
      After tea, at an informal gathering of prefects in his study, Flint
      related the adventure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's been playin' for this for a week, and now he's got it. You know as
      well as I do that if he hadn't been gassing at us the way he has, that
      young devil Beetle wouldn't have dreamed of marbles.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We know that,&rdquo; said Perowne, &ldquo;but that isn't the question. On Flint's
      showin' King has called the prefects names enough to justify a first-class
      row. Crammers' rejections, ill-regulated hobble-de-hoys, wasn't it? Now
      it's impossible for prefects&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rot,&rdquo; said Flint. &ldquo;King's the best classical cram we've got; and 'tisn't
      fair to bother the Head with a row. He's up to his eyes with extra-tu and
      Army work as it is. Besides, as I told King, we <i>aren't</i> a public
      school. We're a limited liability company payin' four per cent. My
      father's a shareholder, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's that got to do with it?&rdquo; said Venner, a red-headed boy of
      nineteen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, seems to me that we should be interferin' with ourselves. We've got
      to get into the Army or&mdash;get out, haven't we? King's hired by the
      Council to teach us. All the rest's gumdiddle. Can't you see?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It might have been because he felt the air was a little thunderous that
      the Head took his after-dinner cheroot to Flint's study; but he so often
      began an evening in a prefect's room that nobody suspected when he drifted
      in pensively, after the knocks that etiquette demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Prefects' meeting?&rdquo; A cock of one wise eye-brow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not exactly, sir; we're just talking things over. Won't you take the easy
      chair?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanks. Luxurious infants, you are.&rdquo; He dropped into Flint's big
      half-couch and puffed for a while in silence. &ldquo;Well, since you're all
      here, I may confess that I'm the mute with the bowstring.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young faces grew serious. The phrase meant that certain of their
      number would be withdrawn from all further games for extra-tuition. It
      might also mean future success at Sandhurst; but it was present ruin for
      the First Fifteen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I've come for my pound of flesh. I ought to have had you out before
      the Exeter match; but it's our sacred duty to beat Exeter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn't the Old Boys' match sacred, too, sir?&rdquo; said Perowne. The Old Boys'
      match was the event of the Easter term.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We'll hope they aren't in training. Now for the list. First I want Flint.
      It's the Euclid that does it. You must work deductions with me. Perowne,
      extra mechanical drawing. Dawson goes to Mr. King for extra Latin, and
      Venner to me for German. Have I damaged the First Fifteen much?&rdquo; He smiled
      sweetly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ruined it, I'm afraid, sir,&rdquo; said Flint. &ldquo;Can't you let us off till the
      end of the term?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Impossible. It will be a tight squeeze for Sandhurst this year.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And all to be cut up by those vile Afghans, too,&rdquo; said Dawson. &ldquo;Wouldn't
      think there'd be so much competition, would you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that reminds me. Crandall is coming down with the Old Boys&mdash;I've
      asked twenty of them, but we shan't get more than a weak team. I don't
      know whether he'll be much use, though. He was rather knocked about,
      recovering poor old Duncan's body.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Crandall major&mdash;the Gunner?&rdquo; Perowne asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, the minor&mdash;'Toffee' Crandall&mdash;in a native infantry
      regiment. He was almost before your time, Perowne.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The papers didn't say anything about him. We read about Fat-Sow, of
      course. What's Crandall done, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've brought over an Indian paper that his mother sent me. It was rather
      a&mdash;hefty, I think you say&mdash;piece of work. Shall I read it?&rdquo; The
      Head knew how to read. When he had finished the quarter-column of close
      type everybody thanked him politely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good for the old Coll.!&rdquo; said Perowne. &ldquo;Pity he wasn't in time to save
      Fat-Sow, though. That's nine to us, isn't it, in the last three years?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes... And I took old Duncan off all games for extra-tu five years ago
      this term,&rdquo; said the Head. &ldquo;By the way, who do you hand over the Games to,
      Flint?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Haven't thought yet. Who'd you recommend, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, thank you. I've heard it casually hinted behind my back that the
      Prooshan Bates is a downy bird, but he isn't going to make himself
      responsible for a new Head of the Games. Settle it among yourselves.
      Good-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And that's the man,&rdquo; said Flint, when the door shut, &ldquo;that you want to
      bother with a dame's school row.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was only pullin' your fat leg,&rdquo; Perowne returned, hastily. &ldquo;You're so
      easy to draw, Flint.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, never mind that. The Head's knocked the First Fifteen to bits, and
      we've got to pick up the pieces, or the Old Boys will have a walk-over.
      Let's promote all the Second Fifteen and make Big Side play up. There's
      heaps of talent somewhere that we can polish up between now and the
      match.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The case was represented so urgently to the school that even Stalky and
      McTurk, who affected to despise football, played one Big-Side game
      seriously. They were forthwith promoted ere their ardor had time to cool,
      and the dignity of their Caps demanded that they should keep some show of
      virtue. The match-team was worked at least four days out of seven, and the
      school saw hope ahead.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the last week of the term the Old Boys began to arrive, and their
      welcome was nicely proportioned to their worth. Gentlemen cadets from
      Sandhurst and Woolwich, who had only left a year ago, but who carried
      enormous side, were greeted with a cheerful &ldquo;Hullo! What's the Shop like?&rdquo;
       from those who had shared their studies. Militia subalterns had more
      consideration, but it was understood they were not precisely of the true
      metal. Recreants who, failing for the Army, had gone into business or
      banks were received for old sake's sake, but in no way made too much of.
      But when the real subalterns, officers and gentlemen full-blown&mdash;who
      had been to the ends of the earth and back again and so carried no side&mdash;came
      on the scene strolling about with the Head, the school divided right and
      left in admiring silence. And when one laid hands on Flint, even upon the
      Head of the Games crying, &ldquo;Good Heavens! What do you mean by growing in
      this way? You were a beastly little fag when I left,&rdquo; visible haloes
      encircled Flint. They would walk to and fro in the corridor with the
      little red school-sergeant, telling news of old regiments; they would
      burst into form-rooms sniffing the well-remembered smells of ink and
      whitewash; they would find nephews and cousins in the lower forms and
      present them with enormous wealth; or they would invade the gymnasium and
      make Foxy show off the new stock on the bars.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chiefly, though, they talked with the Head, who was father-confessor and
      agent-general to them all; for what they shouted in their unthinking
      youth, they proved in their thoughtless manhood&mdash;to wit, that the
      Prooshan Bates was &ldquo;a downy bird.&rdquo; Young blood who had stumbled into an
      entanglement with a pastry-cook's daughter at Plymouth; experience who had
      come into a small legacy but mistrusted lawyers; ambition halting at
      cross-roads, anxious to take the one that would lead him farthest;
      extravagance pursued by the money-lender; arrogance in the thick of a
      regimental row&mdash;each carried his trouble to the Head; and Chiron
      showed him, in language quite unfit for little boys, a quiet and safe way
      round, out, or under. So they overflowed his house, smoked his cigars, and
      drank his health as they had drunk it all the earth over when two or three
      of the old school had foregathered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't stop smoking for a minute,&rdquo; said the Head. &ldquo;The more you're out of
      training the better for us. I've demoralized the First Fifteen with
      extra-tu.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, but we're a scratch lot. Have you told 'em we shall need a substitute
      even if Crandall can play?&rdquo; said a Lieutenant of Engineers with a D.S.O.
      to his credit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He wrote me he'd play, so he can't have been much hurt. He's coming down
      to-morrow morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Crandall minor that was, and brought off poor Duncan's body?&rdquo; The Head
      nodded. &ldquo;Where are you going to put him? We've turned you out of house and
      home already, Head Sahib.&rdquo; This was a Squadron Commander of Bengal
      Lancers, home on leave.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm afraid he'll have to go up to his old dormitory. You know old boys
      can claim that privilege. Yes, I think little Crandall minor must bed down
      there once more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bates Sahib &ldquo;&mdash;a Gunner flung a heavy arm round the Head's neck&mdash;&ldquo;you've
      got something up your sleeve. Confess! I know that twinkle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can't you see, you cuckoo?&rdquo; a Submarine Miner interrupted. &ldquo;Crandall goes
      up to the dormitory as an object-lesson, for moral effect and so forth.
      Isn't that true, Head Sahib?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is. You know too much, Purvis. I licked you for that in '79.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You did, sir, and it's my private belief you chalked the cane.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;N-no. But I've a very straight eye. Perhaps that misled you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That opened the flood-gates of fresh memories, and they all told tales out
      of school.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Crandall minor that was&mdash;Lieutenant R. Crandall of an ordinary
      Indian regiment&mdash;arrived from Exeter on the morning of the match, he
      was cheered along the whole front of the College, for the prefects had
      repeated the sense of that which the Head had read them in Flint's study.
      When Prout's house understood that he would claim his Old Boy's right to a
      bed for one night, Beetle ran into King's house next door and executed a
      public &ldquo;gloat&rdquo; up and down the enemy's big form-room, departing in a haze
      of ink-pots.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What d'you take any notice of those rotters for?&rdquo; said Stalky, playing
      substitute for the Old Boys, magnificent in black jersey, white knickers,
      and black stockings. &ldquo;I talked to <i>him</i> up in the dormitory when he
      was changin'. Pulled his sweater down for him. He's cut about all over the
      arms&mdash;horrid purply ones. He's goin' to tell us about it to-night. I
      asked him to when I was lacin' his boots.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you <i>have</i> got cheek,&rdquo; said Beetle, enviously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Slipped out before I thought. But he wasn't a bit angry. He's no end of a
      chap. I swear, I'm goin' to play up like beans. Tell Turkey!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The technique of that match belongs to a bygone age. Scrimmages were tight
      and enduring; hacking was direct and to the purpose; and around the
      scrimmage stood the school, crying, &ldquo;Put down your heads and shove!&rdquo;
       Toward the end everybody lost all sense of decency, and mothers of
      day-boys too close to the touch-line heard language not included in the
      bills. No one was actually carried off the field, but both sides felt
      happier when time was called, and Beetle helped Stalky and McTurk into
      their overcoats. The two had met in the many-legged heart of things, and,
      as Stalky said, had &ldquo;done each other proud.&rdquo; As they swaggered woodenly
      behind the teams&mdash;substitutes do not rank as equals of hairy men&mdash;they
      passed a pony-carriage near the wall, and a husky voice cried, &ldquo;Well
      played. Oh, played indeed!&rdquo; It was Stettson major, white-checked and
      hollow-eyed, who had fought his way to the ground under escort of an
      impatient coachman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hullo, Stettson,&rdquo; said Stalky, checking. &ldquo;Is it safe to come near you
      yet?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes. I'm all right. They wouldn't let me out before, but I had to
      come to the match. Your mouth looks pretty plummy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Turkey trod on it accidental-done-a-purpose. Well, I'm glad you're
      better, because we owe you something. You and your membranes got us into a
      sweet mess, young man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I heard of that,&rdquo; said the boy, giggling. &ldquo;The Head told me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dooce he did! When?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, come on up to Coll. My shin'll stiffen if we stay jawin' here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shut up, Turkey. I want to find out about this. Well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was stayin' at our house all the time I was ill.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What for? Neglectin' the Coll. that way? 'Thought he was in town.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was off my head, you know, and they said I kept on callin' for him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cheek! You're only a day-boy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He came just the same, and he about saved my life. I was all bunged up
      one night&mdash;just goin' to croak, the doctor said&mdash;and they stuck
      a tube or somethin' in my throat, and the Head sucked out the stuff.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ugh! 'Shot if <i>I</i> would!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He ought to have got diphtheria himself, the doctor said. So he stayed on
      at our house instead of going back. I'd ha' croaked in another twenty
      minutes, the doctor says.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here the coachman, being under orders, whipped up and nearly ran over the
      three.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My Hat!&rdquo; said Beetle. &ldquo;That's pretty average heroic.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pretty average!&rdquo; McTurk's knee in the small of his back cannoned him into
      Stalky, who punted him back. &ldquo;You ought to be hung!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the Head ought to get the V.C.,&rdquo; said Stalky. &ldquo;Why, he might have
      been dead <i>and</i> buried by now. But he wasn't. But he didn't. Ho! ho!
      He just nipped through the hedge like a lusty old blackbird.
      Extra-special, five hundred lines, an' gated for a week&mdash;all sereno!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've read o' somethin' like that in a book,&rdquo; said Beetle. &ldquo;Gummy, what a
      chap! Just think of it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm thinking,&rdquo; said McTurk; and he delivered a wild Irish yell that made
      the team turn round.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shut your fat mouth,&rdquo; said Stalky, dancing with impatience. &ldquo;Leave it to
      your Uncle Stalky, and he'll have the Head on toast. If you say a word,
      Beetle, till I give you leave, I swear I'll slay you. <i>Habeo Capitem
      crinibus minimis.</i> I've got him by the short hairs! Now look as if
      nothing had happened.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was no need of guile. The school was too busy cheering the drawn
      match. It hung round the lavatories regardless of muddy boots while the
      team washed. It cheered Crandall minor whenever it caught sight of him,
      and it cheered more wildly than ever after prayers, because the Old Boys
      in evening dress, openly twirling their mustaches, attended, and instead
      of standing with the masters, ranged themselves along the wall immediately
      before the prefects; and the Head called them over, too&mdash;majors,
      minors, and tertiuses, after their old names.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it's all very fine,&rdquo; he said to his guests after dinner, &ldquo;but the
      boys are getting a little out of hand. There will be trouble and sorrow
      later, I'm afraid. You'd better turn in early, Crandall. The dormitory
      will be sitting up for you. I don't know to what dizzy heights you may
      climb in your profession, but I do know you'll never get such absolute
      adoration as you're getting now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Confound the adoration. I want to finish my cigar, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's all pure gold. Go where glory waits, Crandall&mdash;minor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The setting of that apotheosis was a ten-bed attic dormitory,
      communicating through doorless openings with three others. The gas
      flickered over the raw pine washstands. There was an incessant whistling
      of drafts, and outside the naked windows the sea beat on the Pebbleridge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Same old bed&mdash;same old mattress, I believe,&rdquo; said Crandall, yawning.
      &ldquo;Same old everything. Oh, but I'm lame! I'd no notion you chaps could play
      like this.&rdquo; He caressed a battered shin. &ldquo;You've given us all something to
      remember you by.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It needed a few minutes to put them at their ease; and, in some way they
      could not understand, they were more easy when Crandall turned round and
      said his prayers&mdash;a ceremony he had neglected for some years.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I <i>am</i> sorry. I've forgotten to put out the gas.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please don't bother,&rdquo; said the prefect of the dormitory. &ldquo;Worthington
      does that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A nightgowned twelve-year-old, who had been waiting to show off, leaped
      from his bed to the bracket and back again, by way of a washstand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How d'you manage when he's asleep?&rdquo; said Crandall, chuckling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shove a cold cleek down his neck.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was a wet sponge when I was junior in the dormitory... Hullo! What's
      happening?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The darkness had filled with whispers, the sound of trailing rugs, bare
      feet on bare boards, protests, giggles, and threats such as:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be quiet, you ass!... Squattez-vous on the floor, then!... I swear you
      aren't going to sit on <i>my</i> bed!... Mind the tooth-glass,&rdquo; etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sta&mdash;Corkran said,&rdquo; the prefect began, his tone showing his sense of
      Stalky's insolence, &ldquo;that perhaps you'd tell us about that business with
      Duncan's body.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;yes&mdash;yes,&rdquo; ran the keen whispers. &ldquo;Tell us&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's nothing to tell. What on earth are you chaps hoppin' about in the
      cold for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind us,&rdquo; said the voices. &ldquo;Tell about Fat-Sow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So Crandall turned on his pillow and spoke to the generation he could not
      see.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, about three months ago he was commanding a treasure-guard&mdash;a
      cart full of rupees to pay troops with&mdash;five thousand rupees in
      silver. He was comin' to a place called Fort Pearson, near Kalabagh.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was born there,&rdquo; squeaked a small fag. &ldquo;It was called after my uncle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shut up&mdash;you and your uncle! Never mind him, Crandall.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, ne'er mind. The Afridis found out that this treasure was on the
      move, and they ambushed the whole show a couple of miles before he got to
      the fort, and cut up the escort. Duncan was wounded, and the escort hooked
      it. There weren't more than twenty Sepoys all told, and there were any
      amount of Afridis. As things turned out, I was in charge at Fort Pearson.
      Fact was, I'd heard the firing and was just going to see about it, when
      Duncan's men came up. So we all turned back together. They told me
      something about an officer, but I couldn't get the hang of things till I
      saw a chap under the wheels of the cart out in the open, propped up on one
      arm, blazing away with a revolver. You see, the escort had abandoned the
      cart, and the Afridis&mdash;they're an awfully suspicious gang&mdash;thought
      the retreat was a trap&mdash;sort of draw, you know&mdash;and the cart was
      the bait. So they had left poor old Duncan alone. 'Minute they spotted how
      few we were, it was a race across the flat who should reach old Duncan
      first. We ran, and they ran, and we won, and after a little hackin' about
      they pulled off. I never knew it was one of us till I was right on top of
      him. There are heaps of Duncans in the service, and of course the name
      didn't remind me. He wasn't changed at all hardly. He'd been shot through
      the lungs, poor old man, and he was pretty thirsty. I gave him a drink and
      sat down beside him, and&mdash;funny thing, too&mdash;he said, 'Hullo,
      Toffee!' and I said, 'Hullo, Fat-Sow! hope you aren't hurt,' or something
      of the kind. But he died in a minute or two&mdash;never lifted his head
      off my knees... I say, you chaps out there will get your death of cold.
      Better go to bed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right. In a minute. But your cuts&mdash;your cuts. How did you get
      wounded?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was when we were taking the body back to the Fort. They came on
      again, and there was a bit of a scrimmage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you kill any one?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Shouldn't wonder. Good-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-night. Thank you, Crandall. Thanks awf'ly, Crandall. Good-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The unseen crowds withdrew. His own dormitory rustled into bed and lay
      silent for a while.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say, Crandall&rdquo;&mdash;Stalky's voice was tuned to a wholly foreign
      reverence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Suppose a chap found another chap croaking with diphtheria&mdash;all
      bunged up with it&mdash;and they stuck a tube in his throat and the chap
      sucked the stuff out, what would you say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Um,&rdquo; said Crandall, reflectively. &ldquo;I've only heard of one case, and that
      was a doctor. He did it for a woman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, this wasn't a woman. It was just a boy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Makes it all the finer, then. It's about the bravest thing a man can do.
      Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I heard of a chap doin' it. That's all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then he's a brave man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would <i>you</i> funk it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ra-ather. Anybody would. Fancy dying of diphtheria in cold blood.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;ah! Er! Look here!&rdquo; The sentence ended in a grunt, for Stalky
      had leaped out of bed and with McTurk was sitting on the head of Beetle,
      who would have sprung the mine there and then.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next day, which was the last of the term and given up to a few wholly
      unimportant examinations, began with wrath and war. Mr. King had
      discovered that nearly all his house&mdash;it lay, as you know, next door
      but one to Prout's in the long range of buildings&mdash;had unlocked the
      doors between the dormitories and had gone in to listen to a story told by
      Crandall. He went to the Head, clamorous, injured, appealing; for he never
      approved of allowing so-called young men of the world to contaminate the
      morals of boyhood. Very good, said the Head, he would attend to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I'm awf'ly sorry,&rdquo; said Crandall guiltily. &ldquo;I don't think I told
      'em anything they oughtn't to hear. Don't let them get into trouble on my
      account.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tck!&rdquo; the Head answered, with the ghost of a wink. &ldquo;It isn't the boys
      that make trouble; it's the masters. However, Prout and King don't approve
      of dormitory gatherings on this scale, and one must back up the
      house-masters. Moreover, it's hopeless to punish two houses only, so late
      in the term. We must be fair and include everybody. Let's see. They have a
      holiday task for the Easters, which, of course, none of them will ever
      look at. We will give the whole school, except prefects and study-boys,
      regular prep. to-night; and the Common-room will have to supply a master
      to take it. We must be fair to all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Prep. on the last night of the term. Whew!&rdquo; said Crandall, thinking of
      his own wild youth. &ldquo;I fancy there will be larks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The school, frolicking among packed trunks, whooping down the corridor,
      and &ldquo;gloating&rdquo; in form-rooms, received the news with amazement and rage.
      No school in the world did prep. on the last night of the term. This thing
      was monstrous, tyrannical, subversive of law, religion, and morality. They
      would go into the form-rooms, and they would take their degraded holiday
      task with them, but&mdash;here they smiled and speculated what manner of
      man the Common-room would send up against them. The lot fell on Mason,
      credulous and enthusiastic, who loved youth. No other master was anxious
      to take that &ldquo;prep.,&rdquo; for the school lacked the steadying influence of
      tradition; and men accustomed to the ordered routine of ancient
      foundations found it occasionally insubordinate. The four long form-rooms,
      in which all below the rank of study-boys worked, received him with
      thunders of applause. Ere he had coughed twice they favored him with a
      metrical summary of the marriage laws of Great Britain, as recorded by the
      High Priest of the Israelites and commented on by the leader of the host.
      The lower forms reminded him that it was the last day, and that therefore
      he must &ldquo;take it all in play.&rdquo; When he dashed off to rebuke them, the
      Lower Fourth and Upper Third began with one accord to be sick, loudly and
      realistically. Mr. Mason tried, of all vain things under heaven, to argue
      with them, and a bold soul at a back desk bade him &ldquo;take fifty lines for
      not 'olding up 'is 'and before speaking.&rdquo; As one who prided himself upon
      the perfection of his English this cut Mason to the quick, and while he
      was trying to discover the offender, the Upper and Lower Second, three
      form-rooms away, turned out the gas and threw ink-pots. It was a pleasant
      and stimulating &ldquo;prep.&rdquo; The study-boys and prefects heard the echoes of it
      far off, and the Common-room at dessert smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stalky waited, watch in hand, till half-past eight. &ldquo;If it goes on much
      longer the Head will come up,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;We'll tell the studies first, and
      then the dorm-rooms. Look sharp!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He allowed no time for Beetle to be dramatic or McTurk to drawl. They
      poured into study after study, told their tale, and went again so soon as
      they saw they were understood, waiting for no comment; while the noise of
      that unholy &ldquo;prep.&rdquo; grew and deepened. By the door of Flint's study they
      met Mason flying towards the corridor.&mdash;&ldquo;He's gone to fetch the Head.
      Hurry up! Come on!&rdquo; They broke into Number Twelve form-room abreast and
      panting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Head! The Head! The Head!&rdquo; That call stilled the tumult for a minute,
      and Stalky, leaping to a desk, shouted, &ldquo;He went and sucked the diphtheria
      stuff out of Stettson major's throat when we thought he was in town. Stop
      rotting, you asses! Stettson major would have croaked if the Head hadn't
      done it. The Head might have died himself. Crandall says it's the bravest
      thing any livin' man can do, and I&rdquo;&mdash;his voice cracked&mdash;&ldquo;the
      Head don't know we know!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      McTurk and Beetle, jumping from desk to desk, drove the news home among
      the junior forms. There was a pause, and then, Mason behind him, the Head
      entered. It was in the established order of things that no boy should
      speak or move under his eye. He expected the hush of awe. He was received
      with cheers&mdash;steady, ceaseless cheering. Being a wise man, he went
      away, and the forms were silent and a little frightened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's all right,&rdquo; said Stalky. &ldquo;He can't do much. 'Tisn't as if you'd
      pulled the desks up like we did when old Carleton took prep. once. Keep it
      up! Hear 'em cheering in the studies!&rdquo; He rocketed out with a yell, to
      find Flint and the prefects lifting the roof off the corridor.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the Head of a limited liability company, paying four per cent., is
      cheered on his saintly way to prayers, not only by four form-rooms of boys
      waiting punishment, but by his trusted prefects, he can either ask for an
      explanation or go his road with dignity, while the senior house-master
      glares like an excited cat and points out to a white and trembling
      mathematical master that certain methods&mdash;not his, thank God&mdash;-usually
      produce certain results. Out of delicacy the Old Boys did not attend that
      call-over; and it was to the school drawn up in the gymnasium that the
      Head spoke icily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not often that I do not understand you; but I confess I do not
      to-night. Some of you, after your idiotic performances at prep., seem to
      think me a fit person to cheer. I am going to show you that I am not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Crash&mdash;crash&mdash;crash&mdash;came the triple cheer that disproved
      it, and the Head glowered under the gas. &ldquo;That is enough. You will gain
      nothing. The little boys (the Lower School did not like that form of
      address) will do me three hundred lines apiece in the holidays. I shall
      take no further notice of them. The Upper School will do me one thousand
      lines apiece in the holidays, to be shown up the evening of the day they
      come back. And further&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gummy, what a glutton!&rdquo; Stalky whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For your behavior towards Mr. Mason I intend to lick the whole of the
      Upper School to-morrow when I give you your journey-money. This will
      include the three study-boys I found dancing on the form-room desks when I
      came up. Prefects will stay after call-over.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The school filed out in silence, but gathered in groups by the gymnasium
      door waiting what might befall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now, Flint,&rdquo; said the Head, &ldquo;will you be good enough to give me some
      explanation of your conduct?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, sir,&rdquo; said Flint desperately, &ldquo;if you save a chap's life at the
      risk of your own when he's dyin' of diphtheria, and the Coll. finds it
      out, wha-what can you expect, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Um, I see. Then that noise was not meant for&mdash;ah, cheek. I can
      connive at immorality, but I cannot stand impudence. However, it does not
      excuse their insolence to Mr. Mason. I'll forego the lines this once,
      remember; but the lickings hold good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When this news was made public, the school, lost in wonder and admiration,
      gasped at the Head as he went to his house. Here was a man to be
      reverenced. On the rare occasions when he caned he did it very
      scientifically, and the execution of a hundred boys would be epic&mdash;immense.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's all right, Head Sahib. <i>We</i> know,&rdquo; said Crandall, as the Head
      slipped off his gown with a grunt in his smoking-room. &ldquo;I found out just
      now from our substitute. He was gettin' my opinion of your performance
      last night in the dormitory. I didn't know then that it was you he was
      talkin' about. Crafty young animal. Freckled chap with eyes&mdash;-Corkran,
      I think his name is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I know <i>him</i>, thank you,&rdquo; said the Head, and reflectively.
      &ldquo;Ye-es, I should have included them even if I hadn't seen 'em.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If the old Coll. weren't a little above themselves already, we'd chair
      you down the corridor,&rdquo; said the Engineer. &ldquo;Oh, Bates, how could you? You
      might have caught it yourself, and where would we have been, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I always knew you were worth twenty of us any day. Now I'm sure of it,&rdquo;
       said the Squadron Commander, looking round for contradictions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He isn't fit to manage a school, though. Promise you'll never do it
      again, Bates Sahib. We&mdash;we can't go away comfy in our minds if you
      take these risks,&rdquo; said the Gunner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bates Sahib, you aren't ever goin' to cane the whole Upper School, are
      you?&rdquo; said Crandall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can connive at immorality, as I said, but I can't stand impudence.
      Mason's lot is quite hard enough even when I back him. Besides, the men at
      the golf-club heard them singing 'Aaron and Moses.' I shall have
      complaints about that from the parents of day-boys. Decency must be
      preserved.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We're coming to help,&rdquo; said all the guests.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Upper School were caned one after the other, their overcoats over
      their arms, the brakes waiting in the road below to take them to the
      station, their journey-money on the table. The Head began with Stalky,
      McTurk, and Beetle. He dealt faithfully by them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And here's your journey-money. Good-by, and pleasant holidays.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-by. Thank you, sir. Good-by.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They shook hands. &ldquo;Desire don't outrun performance&mdash;much&mdash;this
      mornin'. We got the cream of it,&rdquo; said Stalky. &ldquo;Now wait till a few chaps
      come out, and we'll really cheer him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't wait on our account, please,&rdquo; said Crandall, speaking for the Old
      Boys. &ldquo;We're going to begin now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was very well so long as the cheering was confined to the corridor, but
      when it spread to the gymnasium, when the boys awaiting their turn
      cheered, the Head gave it up in despair, and the remnant flung themselves
      upon him to shake hands. Then they seriously devoted themselves to
      cheering till the brakes were hustled off the premises in dumb-show.
    </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Didn't I say I'd get even with him?&rdquo; said Stalky on the box-seat, as
they swung into the narrow Northam street. &ldquo;Now all together&mdash;takin'
time from your Uncle Stalky:
</p>
<pre>
   It's a way we have in the Army,
   It's a way we have in the Navy,
   It's a way we have at the Public Schools,
   Which nobody can deny!&rdquo;

    <h2>
      THE FLAG OF THEIR COUNTRY.
    </h2>
    <p>
      It was winter and bitter cold of mornings. Consequently Stalky and Beetle&mdash;McTurk
      being of the offensive type that makes ornate toilet under all
      circumstances&mdash;drowsed till the last moment before turning out to
      call-over in the gas-lit gymnasium. It followed that they were often late;
      and since every unpunctuality earned them a black mark, and since three
      black marks a week meant defaulters' drill, equally it followed that they
      spent hours under the Sergeant's hand. Foxy drilled the defaulters with
      all the pomp of his old parade-ground. &ldquo;Don't think it's any pleasure to
      me&rdquo; (his introduction never varied). &ldquo;I'd much sooner be smoking a quiet
      pipe in my own quarters&mdash;but I see we 'ave the Old Brigade on our
      'ands this afternoon. If I only 'ad you regular, Muster Corkran,&rdquo; said he,
      dressing the line.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You've had me for nearly six weeks, you old glutton. Number off from the
      right!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not <i>quite</i> so previous, please. I'm taking this drill. Left, half&mdash;turn!
      Slow&mdash;march.&rdquo; Twenty-five sluggards, all old offenders, filed into
      the gymnasium. &ldquo;Quietly provide yourselves with the requisite dumb-bells;
      returnin' quietly to your place. Number off from the right, in a low
      voice. Odd numbers one pace to the front. Even numbers stand fast. Now,
      leanin' forward from the 'ips, takin' your time from me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The dumb-bells rose and fell, clashed and were returned as one. The boys
      were experts at the weary game.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ve-ry good. I shall be sorry when any of you resume your 'abits of
      punctuality. Quietly return dumb-bells. We will now try some simple
      drill.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ugh! I know that simple drill.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would he 'ighly to your discredit if you did not, Muster Corkran. <i>At</i>
      the same time, it is not so easy as it looks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bet you a bob, I can drill as well as you, Foxy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We'll see later. Now try to imagine you ain't defaulters at all, but an
      'arf company on parade, me bein' your commandin' officer. There's no call
      to laugh. If you're lucky, most of you will 'ave to take drills 'arf your
      life. Do me a little credit. You've been at it long enough, goodness
      knows.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They were formed into fours, marched, wheeled, and countermarched, the
      spell of ordered motion strong on them. As Foxy said, they had been at it
      a long time.
    </p>
    <p>
      The gymnasium door opened, revealing McTurk in charge of an old gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Sergeant, leading a wheel, did not see. &ldquo;Not so bad,&rdquo; he murmured.
      &ldquo;Not 'arf so bad. The pivot-man of the wheel <i>honly</i> marks time,
      Muster Swayne. Now, Muster Corkran, you say you know the drill? Oblige me
      by takin' over the command and, reversin' my words step by step, relegate
      them to their previous formation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's this? What's this?&rdquo; cried the visitor authoritatively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A&mdash;a little drill, sir,&rdquo; stammered Foxy, saying nothing of first
      causes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excellent&mdash;excellent. I only wish there were more of it,&rdquo; he
      chirruped. &ldquo;Don't let me interrupt. You were just going to hand over to
      someone, weren't you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He sat down, breathing frostily in the chill air. &ldquo;I shall muck it. I know
      I shall,&rdquo; whispered Stalky uneasily; and his discomfort was not lightened
      by a murmur from the rear rank that the old gentleman was General
      Collinson, a member of the College Board of Council.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh&mdash;what?&rdquo; said Foxy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Collinson, K.C.B.&mdash;He commanded the Pompadours&mdash;my father's old
      regiment,&rdquo; hissed Swayne major.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take your time,&rdquo; said the visitor. &ldquo;<i>I</i> know how it feels. Your
      first drill&mdash;eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo; He drew an unhappy breath. &ldquo;'Tention. Dress!&rdquo; The echo of his
      own voice restored his confidence.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wheel was faced about, flung back, broken into fours, and restored to
      line without a falter. The official hour of punishment was long passed,
      but no one thought of that. They were backing up Stalky&mdash;Stalky in
      deadly fear lest his voice should crack.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He does you credit, Sergeant,&rdquo; was the visitor's comment. &ldquo;A good drill&mdash;and
      good material to drill. Now, it's an extraordinary thing: I've been
      lunching with your head-master and he never told me you had a cadet-corps
      in the College.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We 'aven't, sir. This is only a little drill,&rdquo; said the Sergeant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But aren't they keen on it?&rdquo; said McTurk, speaking for the first time,
      with a twinkle in his deep-set eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why aren't you in it, though, Willy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I'm not punctual enough,&rdquo; said McTurk. &ldquo;The Sergeant only takes the
      pick of us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dismiss! Break off!&rdquo; cried Foxy, fearing an explosion in the ranks. &ldquo;I&mdash;I
      ought to have told you, sir, that&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you should have a cadet-corps.&rdquo; The General pursued his own line of
      thought. &ldquo;You <i>shall</i> have a cadet-corps, too, if my recommendation
      in Council is any use. I don't know when I've been so pleased. Boys
      animated by a spirit like yours should set an example to the whole
      school.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They do,&rdquo; said McTurk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bless my soul! Can it be so late? I've kept my fly waiting half an hour.
      Well, I must run away. Nothing like seeing things for one's self. Which
      end of the buildings does one get out at? Will you show me, Willy? Who was
      that boy who took the drill?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Corkran, I think his name is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You ought to know him. That's the kind of boy you should cultivate.
      Evidently an unusual sort. A wonderful sight. Five and twenty boys, who, I
      dare say, would much sooner be playing cricket&rdquo;&mdash;(it was the depth of
      winter; but grown people, especially those who have lived long in foreign
      parts, make these little errors, and McTurk did not correct him)&mdash;&ldquo;drilling
      for the sheer love of it. A shame to waste so much good stuff; but I think
      I can carry my point.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An' who's your friend with the white whiskers?&rdquo; demanded Stalky, on
      McTurk's return to the study.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;General Collinson. He comes over to shoot with my father sometimes.
      Rather a decent old bargee, too. He said I ought to cultivate your
      acquaintance, Stalky.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did he tip you?&rdquo; McTurk exhibited a blessed whole sovereign.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said Stalky, annexing it, for he was treasurer. &ldquo;We'll have a hefty
      brew. You'd pretty average cool cheek, Turkey, to jaw about our keenness
      an' punctuality.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Didn't the old boy know we were defaulters?&rdquo; said Beetle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not him. He came down to lunch with the Head. I found him pokin' about
      the place on his own hook afterwards, an' I thought I'd show him the giddy
      drill. When I found he was so pleased, I wasn't goin' to damp his giddy
      ardor. He mightn't ha' given me the quid if I had.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wasn't old Foxy pleased? Did you see him get pink behind the ears?&rdquo; said
      Beetle. &ldquo;It was an awful score for him. Didn't we back him up beautifully?
      Let's go down to Keyte's and get some cocoa and sassingers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They overtook Foxy, speeding down to retail the adventure to Keyte, who in
      his time had been Troop Sergeant-Major in a cavalry regiment, and now,
      war-worn veteran, was local postmaster and confectioner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You owe us something,&rdquo; said Stalky, with meaning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm 'ighly grateful, Muster Corkran. I've 'ad to run against you pretty
      hard in the way o' business, now and then, but I will say that outside o'
      business&mdash;bounds an' smokin', an' such like&mdash;I don't wish to
      have a more trustworthy young gentleman to 'elp me out of a hole. The way
      you 'andled the drill was beautiful, though I say it. Now, if you come
      regular henceforward&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But he'll have to be late three times a week,&rdquo; said Beetle. &ldquo;You can't
      expect a chap to do that&mdash;just to please you, Foxy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, that's true. Still, if you could manage it&mdash;and you, Muster
      Beetle&mdash;it would give you a big start when the cadet-corps is formed.
      I expect the General will recommend it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They raided Keyte's very much at their own sweet will, for the old man,
      who knew them well, was deep in talk with Foxy. &ldquo;I make what we've taken
      seven and six,&rdquo; Stalky called at last over the counter; &ldquo;but you'd better
      count for yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;no. I'd take your word any day, Muster Corkran.&mdash;In the
      Pompadours, was he, Sergeant? We lay with them once at Umballa, I think it
      was.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know whether this ham-and-tongue tin is eighteen pence or one an'
      four.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say one an' fourpence, Muster Corkran... Of course, Sergeant, if it was
      any use to give my time, I'd be pleased to do it, but I'm too old. I'd
      like to see a drill again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, come on, Stalky,&rdquo; cried McTurk. &ldquo;He isn't listenin' to you. Chuck
      over the money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want the quid changed, you ass. Keyte! Private Keyte! Corporal Keyte!
      Terroop-Sergeant-Major Keyte, will you give me change for a quid?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;yes, of course. Seven an' six.&rdquo; He stared abstractedly, pushed
      the silver over, and melted away into the darkness of the back room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now those two'll jaw about the Mutiny till tea-time,&rdquo; said Beetle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Old Keyte was at Sobraon,&rdquo; said Stalky. &ldquo;Hear him talk about that
      sometimes! Beats Foxy hollow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Head's face, inscrutable as ever, was bent over a pile of letters.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you think?&rdquo; he said at last to the Reverend John Gillett.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's a good idea. There's no denying that&mdash;an estimable idea.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We concede that much. Well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have my doubts about it&mdash;that's all. The more I know of boys the
      less do I profess myself capable of following their moods; but I own I
      shall be very much surprised if the scheme takes. It&mdash;it isn't the
      temper of the school. We prepare for the Army.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My business&mdash;in <i>this</i> matter&mdash;is to carry out the wishes
      of the Council. They demand a volunteer cadet-corps. A volunteer
      cadet-corps will be furnished. I have suggested, however, that we need not
      embark upon the expense of uniforms till we are drilled. General Collinson
      is sending us fifty lethal weapons&mdash;cut-down Sniders, he calls them&mdash;all
      carefully plugged.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, that is necessary in a school that uses loaded saloon-pistols to the
      extent we do.&rdquo; The Reverend John smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Therefore there will be no outlay except the Sergeant's time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But if he fails you will be blamed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, assuredly. I shall post a notice in the corridor this afternoon, and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall watch the result.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kindly keep your 'ands off the new arm-rack.&rdquo; Foxy wrestled with a
      turbulent crowd in the gymnasium. &ldquo;Nor it won't do even a condemned Snider
      any good to be continual snappin' the lock, Mr. Swayne.&mdash;Yiss, the
      uniforms will come later, when we're more proficient; at present we will
      confine ourselves to drill. I am 'ere for the purpose o' takin' the names
      o' those willin' to join.&mdash;Put down that Snider, Muster Hogan!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you goin' to do, Beetle?&rdquo; said a voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've had all the drill <i>I</i> want, thank you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! After all you've learned? Come on! Don't be a scab! They'll make
      you corporal in a week,&rdquo; cried Stalky.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm not goin' up for the Army.&rdquo; Beetle touched his spectacles.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hold on a shake, Foxy,&rdquo; said Hogan. &ldquo;Where are you goin' to drill us?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here&mdash;in the gym&mdash;till you are fit an' capable to be taken out
      on the road.&rdquo; The Sergeant threw a chest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For all the Northam cads to look at? Not good enough, Foxibus.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, we won't make a point of it. You learn your drill first, an' later
      we'll see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hullo,&rdquo; said Ansell of Macrea's, shouldering through the mob. &ldquo;What's all
      this about a giddy cadet-corps?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will save you a lot o' time at Sandburst,&rdquo; the Sergeant replied
      promptly. &ldquo;You'll be dismissed your drills early if you go up with a good
      groundin' before'and.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hm! 'Don't mind learnin' my drill, but I'm not goin' to ass about the
      country with a toy Snider. Perowne, what are you goin' to do? Hogan's
      joinin'.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't know whether I've the time,&rdquo; said Perowne. &ldquo;I've got no end of
      extra-tu as it is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, call this extra-tu,&rdquo; said Ansell. &ldquo;'Twon't take us long to mug up
      the drill.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that's right enough, but what about marchin' in public?&rdquo; said Hogan,
      not foreseeing that three years later he should die in the Burmese
      sun-light outside Minhla Fort.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Afraid the uniform won't suit your creamy complexion?&rdquo; McTurk asked with
      a villainous sneer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shut up, Turkey. You aren't goin' up for the Army.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, but I'm goin' to send a substitute. Hi! Morrell an' Wake! You two
      fags by the arm-rack, you've got to volunteer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Blushing deeply&mdash;they had been too shy to apply before&mdash;the
      youngsters sidled towards the Sergeant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I don't want the little chaps&mdash;not at first,&rdquo; said the Sergeant
      disgustedly. &ldquo;I want&mdash;I'd like some of the Old Brigade the defaulters&mdash;to
      stiffen 'em a bit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't be ungrateful, Sergeant. They're nearly as big as you get 'em in
      the Army now.&rdquo; McTurk read the papers of those years and could be trusted
      for general information, which he used as he used his &ldquo;tweaker.&rdquo; Yet he
      did not know that Wake minor would be a bimbashi of the Egyptian Army ere
      his thirtieth year.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hogan, Swayne, Stalky, Perowne, and Ansell were deep in consultation by
      the vaulting-horse, Stalky as usual laying down the law. The Sergeant
      watched them uneasily, knowing that many waited on their lead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Foxy don't like my recruits,&rdquo; said McTurk, in a pained tone, to Beetle.
      &ldquo;You get him some.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nothing loath, Beetle pinioned two more fags&mdash;each no taller than a
      carbine. &ldquo;Here you are, Foxy. Here's food for powder. Strike for your
      hearths an' homes, you young brutes&mdash;an' be jolly quick about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Still he isn't happy,&rdquo; said McTurk.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   &ldquo;For the way we have with our Army
   Is the way we have with our Navy.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Here Beetle joined in. They had found the poem in an old volume of
      &ldquo;Punch,&rdquo; and it seemed to cover the situation:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   &ldquo;An' both of 'em led to adversity,
   Which nobody can deny!&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You be quiet, young gentlemen. If you can't 'elp&mdash;don't 'inder.&rdquo;
       Foxy's eye was still on the council by the horse. Carter, White, and
      Tyrrell, all boys of influence, had joined it. The rest fingered the
      rifles irresolutely. &ldquo;Wait a shake,&rdquo; cried Stalky. &ldquo;Can't we turn out
      those rotters before we get to work?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; said Foxy. &ldquo;Any one wishful to join will stay 'ere. Those who
      do not so intend will go out, quietly closin' the door be'ind 'em.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Half a dozen of the earnest-minded rushed at them, and they had just time
      to escape into the corridor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, why don't you join?&rdquo; Beetle asked, resettling his collar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why didn't you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's the good? We aren't goin' up for the Army. Besides, I know the
      drill&mdash;all except the manual, of course. 'Wonder what they're doin'
      inside?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Makin' a treaty with Foxy. Didn't you hear Stalky say: 'That's what we'll
      do&mdash;an' if he don't like it he can lump it'? They'll use Foxy for a
      cram. Can't you see, you idiot? They're goin' up for Sandhurst or the Shop
      in less than a year. They'll learn their drill an' then they'll drop it
      like a shot. D'you suppose chaps with their amount of extra-tu are takin'
      up volunteerin' for fun?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I don't know. I thought of doin' a poem about it&mdash;rottin' 'em,
      you know&mdash;'The Ballad of the Dogshooters'&mdash;eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't think you can, because King'll be down on the corps like a
      cartload o' bricks. He hasn't been consulted, he's sniffin' round the
      notice-board now. Let's lure him.&rdquo; They strolled up carelessly towards the
      honse-master&mdash;a most meek couple.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How's this?&rdquo; said King with a start of feigned surprise. &ldquo;Methought you
      would be learning to fight for your country.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think the company's full, sir,&rdquo; said McTurk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's a great pity,&rdquo; sighed Beetle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forty valiant defenders, have we, then? How noble! What devotion! I
      presume that it is possible that a desire to evade their normal
      responsibilities may be at the bottom of this zeal. Doubtless they will be
      accorded special privileges, like the Choir and the Natural History
      Society&mdash;one must not say Bug-hunters.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I suppose so, sir,&rdquo; said McTurk, cheerily. &ldquo;The Head hasn't said
      anything about it yet, but he will, of course.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, sure to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is just possible, my Beetle,&rdquo; King wheeled on the last speaker, &ldquo;that
      the house-masters&mdash;a necessary but somewhat neglected factor in our
      humble scheme of existence&mdash;may have a word to say on the matter.
      Life, for the young at least, is not all weapons and munitions of war.
      Education is incidentally one of our aims.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a consistent pig he is,&rdquo; cooed McTurk, when they were out of
      earshot. &ldquo;One always knows where to have him. Did you see how he rose to
      that draw about the Head and special privileges?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Confound him, he might have had the decency to have backed the scheme. I
      could do such a lovely ballad, rottin' it; and now I'll have to be a giddy
      enthusiast. It don't bar our pulling Stalky's leg in the study, does it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no; but in the Coll. we must be pro-cadet-corps like anything. Can't
      you make up a giddy epigram, <i>a' la Catullus</i>, about King objectin'
      to it?&rdquo; Beetle was at this noble task when Stalky returned all hot from
      his first drill.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hullo, my ramrod-bunger!&rdquo; began McTurk. &ldquo;Where's your dead dog? Is it
      Defence or Defiance?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Defiance,&rdquo; said Stalky, and leaped on him at that word. &ldquo;Look here,
      Turkey, you mustn't rot the corps. We've arranged it beautifully. Foxy
      swears he won't take us out into the open till we say we want to go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Dis</i>-gustin' exhibition of immature infants apin' the
      idiosyncrasies of their elders. Snff!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you drawn King, Beetle?&rdquo; Stalky asked in a pause of the scuffle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not exactly; but that's his genial style.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, listen to your Uncle Stalky&mdash;who is a great man. Moreover and
      subsequently, Foxy's goin' to let us drill the corps in turn&mdash;<i>privatim
      et seriatim</i>&mdash;so that we'll all know how to handle a half company
      anyhow. <i>Ergo</i>, an' <i>propter hoc</i>, when we go to the Shop we
      shall be dismissed drill early; thus, my beloved 'earers, combinin'
      education with wholesome amusement.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knew you'd make a sort of extra-tu of it, you cold-blooded brute,&rdquo; said
      McTurk. &ldquo;Don't you want to die for your giddy country?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not if I can jolly well avoid it. So you mustn't rot the corps.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We'd decided on that, years ago,&rdquo; said Beetle, scornfully. &ldquo;King'll do
      the rottin'.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you've got to rot King, my giddy poet. Make up a good catchy
      Limerick, and let the fags sing it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here, you stick to volunteerin', and don't jog the table.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He won't have anything to take hold of,&rdquo; said Stalky, with dark
      significance.
    </p>
    <p>
      They did not know what that meant till, a few days later, they proposed to
      watch the corps at drill. They found the gymnasium door locked and a fag
      on guard. &ldquo;This is sweet cheek,&rdquo; said McTurk, stooping.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mustn't look through the key-hole,&rdquo; said the sentry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I like that. Why, Wake, you little beast, I made you a volunteer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can't help it. My orders are not to allow any one to look.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;S'pose we do?&rdquo; said McTurk. &ldquo;S'pose we jolly well slay you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My orders are, I am to give the name of anybody who interfered with me on
      my post, to the corps, an' they'd deal with him after drill, accordin' to
      martial law.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a brute Stalky is!&rdquo; said Beetle. They never doubted for a moment who
      had devised that scheme.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You esteem yourself a giddy centurion, don't you?&rdquo; said Beetle, listening
      to the crash and rattle of grounded arms within.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My orders are, not to talk except to explain my orders&mdash;they'll lick
      me if I do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      McTurk looked at Beetle. The two shook their heads and turned away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I swear Stalky <i>is</i> a great man,&rdquo; said Beetle after a long pause.
      &ldquo;One consolation is that this sort of secret-society biznai will drive
      King wild.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It troubled many more than King, but the members of the corps were muter
      than oysters. Foxy, being bound by no vow, carried his woes to Keyte.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never come across such nonsense in my life. They've tiled the lodge,
      inner and outer guard, all complete, and then they get to work, keen as
      mustard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what's it all for?&rdquo; asked the ex-Troop Sergeant-Major.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To learn their drill. You never saw anything like it. They begin after
      I've dismissed 'em&mdash;practisin' tricks; but out into the open they
      will <i>not</i> come&mdash;not for ever so. The 'ole thing is
      pre-posterous. If you're a cadet-corps, <i>I</i> say, be a cadet-corps,
      instead o' hidin' be'ind locked doors.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what do the authorities say about it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That beats me again.&rdquo; The Sergeant spoke fretfully. &ldquo;I go to the 'Ead an'
      'e gives me no help. There's times when I think he's makin' fun o' me.
      I've never been a Volunteer-sergeant, thank God&mdash;but I've always had
      the consideration to pity 'em. I'm glad o' that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'd like to see 'em,&rdquo; said Keyte. &ldquo;From your statements, Sergeant, I
      can't get at what they're after.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't ask me, Major! Ask that freckle-faced young Corkran. He's their
      generalissimo.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      One does not refuse a warrior of Sobraon, or deny the only pastry-cook
      within bounds. So Keyte came, by invitation, leaning upon a stick,
      tremulous with old age, to sit in a corner and watch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They shape well. They shape uncommon well,&rdquo; he whispered between
      evolutions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, this isn't what they're after. Wait till I dismiss 'em.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At the &ldquo;break-off&rdquo; the ranks stood fast. Perowne fell out, faced them,
      and, refreshing his memory by glimpses at a red-bound, metal-clasped book,
      drilled them for ten minutes. (This is that Perowne who was shot in
      Equatorial Africa by his own men.) Ansell followed him, and Hogan followed
      Ansell. All three were implicitly obeyed. Then Stalky laid aside his
      Snider, and, drawing a long breath, favored the company with a blast of
      withering invective.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Old 'ard, Muster Corkran. That ain't in any drill,&rdquo; cried Foxy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, Sergeant. You never know what you may have to say to your men.&mdash;For
      pity's sake, try to stand up without leanin' against each other, you
      blear-eyed, herrin'-gutted gutter-snipes. It's no pleasure to me to comb
      you out. That ought to have been done before you came here, you&mdash;you
      militia broom-stealers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The old touch&mdash;the old touch. <i>We</i> know it,&rdquo; said Keyte, wiping
      his rheumy eyes. &ldquo;But where did he pick it up?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From his father&mdash;or his uncle. Don't ask me! Half of 'em must have
      been born within earshot o' the barracks.&rdquo; (Foxy was not far wrong in his
      guess.) &ldquo;I've heard more back-talk since this volunteerin' nonsense began
      than I've heard in a year in the service.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's a rear-rank man lookin' as though his belly were in the
      pawn-shop. Yes, you, Private Ansell,&rdquo; and Stalky tongue-lashed the victim
      for three minutes, in gross and in detail.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hullo!&rdquo; He returned to his normal tone. &ldquo;First blood to me. You flushed,
      Ansell. You wriggled.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Couldn't help flushing,&rdquo; was the answer. &ldquo;Don't think I wriggled,
      though.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it's your turn now.&rdquo; Stalky resumed his place in the ranks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lord, Lord! It's as good as a play,&rdquo; chuckled the attentive Keyte.
      Ansell, too, had been blessed with relatives in the service, and slowly,
      in a lazy drawl&mdash;his style was more reflective than Stalky's&mdash;descended
      the abysmal depths of personality.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Blood to me!&rdquo; he shouted triumphantly. &ldquo;You couldn't stand it, either.&rdquo;
       Stalky was a rich red, and his Snider shook visibly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn't think I would,&rdquo; he said, struggling for composure, &ldquo;but after a
      bit I got in no end of a bait. Curious, ain't it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good for the temper,&rdquo; said the slow-moving Hogan, as they returned arms
      to the rack.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you ever?&rdquo; said Foxy, hopelessly, to Keyte.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know much about volunteers, but it's the rummiest show I ever
      saw. I can see what they're gettin' at, though. Lord! how often I've been
      told off an' dressed down in my day! They shape well&mdash;extremely well
      they shape.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I could get 'em out into the open, there's nothing I couldn't do with
      'em, Major. Perhaps when the uniforms come down, they'll change their
      mind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Indeed it was time that the corps made some concession to the curiosity of
      the school. Thrice had the guard been maltreated and thrice had the corps
      dealt out martial law to the offender. The school raged. What was the use,
      they asked, of a cadet-corps which none might see? Mr. King congratulated
      them on their invisible defenders, and they could not parry his thrusts.
      Foxy was growing sullen and restive. A few of the corps expressed openly
      doubts as to the wisdom of their course; and the question of uniforms
      loomed on the near horizon. If these were issued, they would be forced to
      wear them.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, as so often happens in this life, the matter was suddenly settled
      from without.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Head had duly informed the Council that their recommendation had been
      acted upon, and that, so far as he could learn, the boys were drilling. He
      said nothing of the terms on which they drilled. Naturally, General
      Collinson was delighted and told his friends. One of his friends rejoiced
      in a friend, a Member of Parliament&mdash;a zealous, an intelligent, and,
      above all, a patriotic person, anxious to do the most good in the shortest
      possible time. But we cannot answer, alas! for the friends of our friends.
      If Collinson's friend had introduced him to the General, the latter would
      have taken his measure and saved much. But the friend merely spoke of his
      friend; and since no two people in the world see eye to eye, the picture
      conveyed to Collinson was inaccurate. Moreover, the man was an M.P., an
      impeccable Conservative, and the General had the English soldier's lurking
      respect for any member of the Court of Last Appeal. He was going down into
      the West country, to spread light in somebody's benighted constituency.
      Wouldn't it be a good idea if, armed with the General's recommendation,
      he, taking the admirable and newly established cadet-corps for his text,
      spoke a few words&mdash;&ldquo;Just talked to the boys a little&mdash;eh? You
      know the kind of thing that would be acceptable; and he'd be the very man
      to do it. The sort of talk that boys understand, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They didn't talk to 'em much in my time,&rdquo; said the General, suspiciously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! but times change&mdash;with the spread of education and so on. The
      boys of to-day are the men of to-morrow. An impression in youth is likely
      to be permanent. And in these times, you know, with the country going to
      the dogs?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're quite right.&rdquo; The island was then entering on five years of Mr.
      Gladstone's rule; and the General did not like what he had seen of it. He
      would certainly write to the Head, for it was beyond question that the
      boys of to-day made the men of to-morrow. That, if he might say so, was
      uncommonly well put.
    </p>
    <p>
      In reply, the Head stated that he should be delighted to welcome Mr.
      Raymond Martin, M.P., of whom he had heard so much; to put him up for the
      night, and to allow him to address the school on any subject that he
      conceived would interest them. If Mr. Martin had not yet faced an audience
      of this particular class of British youth, the Head had no doubt that he
      would find it an interesting experience.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I don't think I am very far wrong in that last,&rdquo; he confided to the
      Reverend John. &ldquo;Do you happen to know anything of one Raymond Martin?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was at College with a man of that name,&rdquo; the chaplain replied. &ldquo;He was
      without form and void, so far as I remember, but desperately earnest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He will address the Coll. on 'Patriotism' next Saturday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If there is one thing our boys detest more than another it is having
      their Saturday evenings broken into. Patriotism has no chance beside
      'brewing.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nor art either. D'you remember our 'Evening with Shakespeare'?&rdquo; The
      Head's eyes twinkled. &ldquo;Or the humorous gentleman with the magic lantern?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An' who the dooce is this Raymond Martin, M.P.?&rdquo; demanded Beetle, when he
      read the notice of the lecture in the corridor. &ldquo;Why do the brutes always
      turn up on a Saturday?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ouh! Reomeo, Reomeo. Wherefore art thou Reomeo?&rdquo; said McTurk over his
      shoulder, quoting the Shakespeare artiste of last term. &ldquo;Well, he won't be
      as bad as <i>her</i>, I hope. Stalky, are you properly patriotic? Because
      if you ain't, this chap's goin' to make you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hope he won't take up the whole of the evening. I suppose we've got to
      listen to him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wouldn't miss him for the world,&rdquo; said McTurk. &ldquo;A lot of chaps thought
      that Romeo-Romeo woman was a bore. <i>I</i> didn't. I liked her! 'Member
      when she began to hiccough in the middle of it? P'raps he'll hiccough.
      Whoever gets into the Gym first, bags seats for the other two.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was no nervousness, but a brisk and cheery affability about Mr.
      Raymond Martin, M.P., as he drove up, watched by many eyes, to the Head's
      house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Looks a bit of a bargee,&rdquo; was McTurk's comment. &ldquo;Shouldn't be surprised
      if he was a Radical. He rowed the driver about the fare. I heard him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was his giddy patriotism,&rdquo; Beetle explained. After tea they joined
      the rush for seats, secured a private and invisible corner, and began to
      criticise. Every gas-jet was lit. On the little dais at the far end stood
      the Head's official desk, whence Mr. Martin would discourse, and a ring of
      chairs for the masters.
    </p>
    <p>
      Entered then Foxy, with official port, and leaned something like a cloth
      rolled round a stick against the desk. No one in authority was yet
      present, so the school applauded, crying: &ldquo;What's that, Foxy? What are you
      stealin' the gentleman's brolly for?&mdash;We don't birch here. We cane!
      Take away that bauble!&mdash;Number off from the right&rdquo;&mdash;and so
      forth, till the entry of the Head and the masters ended all
      demonstrations.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One good job&mdash;the Common-room hate this as much as we do. Watch King
      wrigglin' to get out of the draft.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where's the Raymondiferous Martin? Punctuality, my beloved 'earers, is
      the image o' war&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shut up. Here's the giddy Dook. Golly, what a dewlap!&rdquo; Mr. Martin, in
      evening dress, was undeniably throaty&mdash;a tall, generously designed,
      pink-and-white man. Still, Beetle need not have been coarse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look at his back while he's talkin' to the Head. Vile bad form to turn
      your back on the audience! He's a Philistine&mdash;a Bopper&mdash;a
      Jebusite&mdash;an' a Hivite.&rdquo; McTurk leaned back and sniffed
      contemptuously.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a few colorless words, the Head introduced the speaker and sat down
      amid applause. When Mr. Martin took the applause to himself, they
      naturally applauded more than ever. It was some time before he could
      begin. He had no knowledge of the school&mdash;its tradition or heritage.
      He did not know that the last census showed that eighty per cent. of the
      boys had been born abroad&mdash;in camp, cantonment, or upon the high
      seas; or that seventy-five per cent. were sons of officers in one or other
      of the services&mdash;Willoughbys, Paulets, De Castros, Maynes, Randalls,
      after their kind&mdash;looking to follow their fathers' profession. The
      Head might have told him this, and much more; but, after an hour-long
      dinner in his company, the Head decided to say nothing whatever. Mr.
      Raymond Martin seemed to know so much already.
    </p>
    <p>
      He plunged into his speech with a long-drawn, rasping &ldquo;Well, boys,&rdquo; that,
      though they were not conscious of it, set every young nerve ajar. He
      supposed they knew&mdash;hey?&mdash;what he had come down for? It was not
      often that he had an opportunity to talk to boys. He supposed that boys
      were very much the same kind of persons&mdash;some people thought them
      rather funny persons&mdash;as they had been in his youth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This man,&rdquo; said McTurk, with conviction, &ldquo;is <i>the</i> Gadarene Swine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But they must remember that they would not always be boys. They would grow
      up into men, because the boys of to-day made the men of to-morrow, and
      upon the men of to-morrow the fair fame of their glorious native land
      depended.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If this goes on, my beloved 'earers, it will be my painful duty to rot
      this bargee.&rdquo; Stalky drew a long breath through his nose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can't do that,&rdquo; said McTurk. &ldquo;He ain't chargin' anything for his Romeo.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And so they ought to think of the duties and responsibilities of the life
      that was opening before them. Life was not all&mdash;he enumerated a few
      games, and, that nothing might be lacking to the sweep and impact of his
      fall, added &ldquo;marbles.&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes, life was not,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;all marbles.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was one tense gasp&mdash;among the juniors almost a shriek&mdash;of
      quivering horror, he was a heathen&mdash;an outcast&mdash;-beyond the
      extremest pale of toleration&mdash;self-damned before all men. Stalky
      bowed his head in his hands. McTurk, with a bright and cheerful eye, drank
      in every word, and Beetle nodded solemn approval.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some of them, doubtless, expected in a few years to have the honor of a
      commission from the Queen, and to wear a sword. Now, he himself had had
      some experience of these duties, as a Major in a volunteer regiment, and
      he was glad to learn that they had established a volunteer corps in their
      midst. The establishment of such an establishment conduced to a proper and
      healthy spirit, which, if fostered, would be of great benefit to the land
      they loved and were so proud to belong to. Some of those now present
      expected, he had no doubt&mdash;some of them anxiously looked forward to
      leading their men against the bullets of England's foes; to confronting
      the stricken field in all the pride of their youthful manhood.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now the reserve of a boy is tenfold deeper than the reserve of a maid, she
      being made for one end only by blind Nature, but man for several. With a
      large and healthy hand, he tore down these veils, and trampled them under
      the well-intentioned feet of eloquence. In a raucous voice, he cried aloud
      little matters, like the hope of Honor and the dream of Glory, that boys
      do not discuss even with their most intimate equals, cheerfully assuming
      that, till he spoke, they had never considered these possibilities. He
      pointed them to shining goals, with fingers which smudged out all radiance
      on all horizons. He profaned the most secret places of their souls with
      outcries and gesticulations, he bade them consider the deeds of their
      ancestors in such a fashion that they were flushed to their tingling ears.
      Some of them&mdash;the rending voice cut a frozen stillness&mdash;might
      have had relatives who perished in defence of their country. They thought,
      not a few of them, of an old sword in a passage, or above a breakfast-room
      table, seen and fingered by stealth since they could walk. He adjured them
      to emulate those illustrious examples; and they looked all ways in their
      extreme discomfort.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their years forbade them even to shape their thoughts clearly to
      themselves. They felt savagely that they were being outraged by a fat man
      who considered marbles a game.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so he worked towards his peroration&mdash;which, by the way, he used
      later with overwhelming success at a meeting of electors&mdash;while they
      sat, flushed and uneasy, in sour disgust. After many, many words, he
      reached for the cloth-wrapped stick and thrust one hand in his bosom. This&mdash;this
      was the concrete symbol of their land&mdash;worthy of all honor and
      reverence! Let no boy look on this flag who did not purpose to worthily
      add to its imperishable lustre. He shook it before them&mdash;a large
      calico Union Jack, staring in all three colors, and waited for the thunder
      of applause that should crown his effort.
    </p>
    <p>
      They looked in silence. They had certainly seen the thing before&mdash;down
      at the coastguard station, or through a telescope, half-mast high when a
      brig went ashore on Braunton Sands; above the roof of the Golf-club, and
      in Keyte's window, where a certain kind of striped sweetmeat bore it in
      paper on each box. But the College never displayed it; it was no part of
      the scheme of their lives; the Head had never alluded to it; their fathers
      had not declared it unto them. It was a matter shut up, sacred and apart.
      What, in the name of everything caddish, was he driving at, who waved that
      horror before their eyes? Happy thought! Perhaps he was drunk.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Head saved the situation by rising swiftly to propose a vote of
      thanks, and at his first motion, the school clapped furiously, from a
      sense of relief.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I am sure,&rdquo; he concluded, the gaslight full on his face, &ldquo;that you
      will all join me in a very hearty vote of thanks to Mr. Raymond Martin for
      the most enjoyable address he has given us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To this day we shall never know the rights of the case. The Head vows that
      he did no such thing; or that, if he did, it must have been something in
      his eye; but those who were present are persuaded that he winked, once,
      openly and solemnly, after the word &ldquo;enjoyable.&rdquo; Mr. Raymond Martin got
      his applause full tale. As he said, &ldquo;Without vanity, I think my few words
      went to their hearts. I never knew boys could cheer like that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He left as the prayer-bell rang, and the boys lined up against the wall.
      The flag lay still unrolled on the desk, Foxy regarding it with pride, for
      he had been touched to the quick by Mr. Martin's eloquence. The Head and
      the Common-room, standing back on the dais, could not see the glaring
      offence, but a prefect left the line, rolled it up swiftly, and as swiftly
      tossed it into a glove and foil locker.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, as though he had touched a spring, broke out the low murmur of
      content, changing to quick-volleyed hand-clapping.
    </p>
    <p>
      They discussed the speech in the dormitories. There was not one
      dissentient voice. Mr. Raymond Martin, beyond question, was born in a
      gutter, and bred in a board-school, where they played marbles. He was
      further (I give the barest handful from great store) a Flopshus Cad, an
      Outrageous Stinker, a Jelly-bellied Flag-flapper (this was Stalky's
      contribution), and several other things which it is not seemly to put
      down.
    </p>
    <p>
      The volunteer cadet-corps fell in next Monday, depressedly, with a face of
      shame. Even then, judicious silence might have turned the corner.
    </p>
    <p>
      Said Foxy: &ldquo;After a fine speech like what you 'eard night before last, you
      ought to take 'old of your drill with <i>re</i>-newed activity. I don't
      see how you can avoid comin' out an' marchin' in the open now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can't we get out of it, then, Foxy?&rdquo; Stalky's fine old silky tone should
      have warned him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, not with his giving the flag so generously. He told me before he left
      this morning that there was no objection to the corps usin' it as their
      own. It's a handsome flag.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Stalky returned his rifle to the rack in dead silence, and fell out. His
      example was followed by Hogan and Ansell. Perowne hesitated. &ldquo;Look here,
      oughtn't we&mdash;?&rdquo; he began.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll get it out of the locker in a minute,&rdquo; said the Sergeant, his back
      turned. &ldquo;Then we can&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come on!&rdquo; shouted Stalky. &ldquo;What the devil are you waiting for? Dismiss!
      Break off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why&mdash;what the&mdash;where the&mdash;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The rattle of Sniders, slammed into the rack, drowned his voice, as boy
      after boy fell out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I don't know that I shan't have to report this to the Head,&rdquo; he
      stammered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Report, then, and be damned to you,&rdquo; cried Stalky, white to the lips, and
      ran out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rummy thing!&rdquo; said Beetle to McTurk. &ldquo;I was in the study, doin' a simply
      lovely poem about the Jelly-Bellied Flag-Flapper, an' Stalky came in, an'
      I said 'Hullo!' an' he cursed me like a bargee, and then he began to blub
      like anything. Shoved his head on the table and howled. Hadn't we better
      do something?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      McTurk was troubled. &ldquo;P'raps he's smashed himself up somehow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They found him, with very bright eyes, whistling between his teeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did I take you in, Beetle? I thought I would. Wasn't it a good draw?
      Didn't you think I was blubbin'? Didn't I do it well? Oh, you fat old
      ass!&rdquo; And he began to pull Beetle's ears and checks, in the fashion that
      was called &ldquo;milking.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knew you were blubbin',&rdquo; Beetle replied, composedly. &ldquo;Why aren't you at
      drill?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Drill! What drill?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't try to be a clever fool. Drill in the Gym.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Cause there isn't any. The volunteer cadet-corps is broke up&mdash;disbanded&mdash;dead&mdash;putrid&mdash;corrupt&mdash;-stinkin'.
      An' if you look at me like that, Beetle, I'll slay you too... Oh, yes, an'
      I'm goin' to be reported to the Head for swearin'.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      THE LAST TERM.
    </h2>
    <p>
      It was within a few days of the holidays, the term-end examinations, and,
      more important still, the issue of the College paper which Beetle edited.
      He had been cajoled into that office by the blandishments of Stalky and
      McTurk and the extreme rigor of study law. Once installed, he discovered,
      as others have done before him, that his duty was to do the work while his
      friends criticized. Stalky christened it the &ldquo;Swillingford Patriot,&rdquo; in
      pious memory of Sponge&mdash;and McTurk compared the output unfavorably
      with Ruskin and De Quincey. Only the Head took an interest in the
      publication, and his methods were peculiar. He gave Beetle the run of his
      brown-bound, tobacco-scented library; prohibiting nothing, recommending
      nothing. There Beetle found a fat arm-chair, a silver inkstand, and
      unlimited pens and paper. There were scores and scores of ancient
      dramatists; there were Hakluyt, his voyages; French translations of
      Muscovite authors called Pushkin and Lermontoff; little tales of a heady
      and bewildering nature, interspersed with unusual songs&mdash;Peacock was
      that writer's name; there was Borrow's &ldquo;Lavengro&rdquo;; an odd theme,
      purporting to be a translation of something, called a &ldquo;Ruba'iyat,&rdquo; which
      the Head said was a poem not yet come to its own; there were hundreds of
      volumes of verse&mdash;-Crashaw; Dryden; Alexander Smith; L. E. L.; Lydia
      Sigourney; Fletcher and a purple island; Donne; Marlowe's &ldquo;Faust &ldquo;; and&mdash;this
      made McTurk (to whom Beetle conveyed it) sheer drunk for three days&mdash;Ossian;
      &ldquo;The Earthly Paradise&rdquo;; &ldquo;Atalanta in Calydon&rdquo;; and Rossetti&mdash;to name
      only a few. Then the Head, drifting in under pretense of playing censor to
      the paper, would read here a verse and here another of these poets,
      opening up avenues. And, slow breathing, with half-shut eyes above his
      cigar, would he speak of great men living, and journals, long dead,
      founded in their riotous youth; of years when all the planets were little
      new-lit stars trying to find their places in the uncaring void, and he,
      the Head, knew them as young men know one another. So the regular work
      went to the dogs, Beetle being full of other matters and meters, hoarded
      in secret and only told to McTurk of an afternoon, on the sands, walking
      high and disposedly round the wreck of the Armada galleons, shouting and
      declaiming against the long-ridged seas.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thanks in large part to their house-master's experienced distrust, the
      three for three consecutive terms had been passed over for promotion to
      the rank of prefect&mdash;an office that went by merit, and carried with
      it the honor of the ground-ash, and liberty, under restrictions, to use
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>But</i>,&rdquo; said Stalky, &ldquo;come to think of it, we've done more giddy
      jesting with the Sixth since we've been passed over than any one else in
      the last seven years.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He touched his neck proudly. It was encircled by the stiffest of stick-up
      collars, which custom decreed could be worn only by the Sixth. And the
      Sixth saw those collars and said no word. &ldquo;Pussy,&rdquo; Abanazar, or Dick Four
      of a year ago would have seen them discarded in five minutes or... But the
      Sixth of that term was made up mostly of young but brilliantly clever
      boys, pets of the house-masters, too anxious for their dignity to care to
      come to open odds with the resourceful three. So they crammed their caps
      at the extreme back of their heads, instead of a trifle over one eye as
      the Fifth should, and rejoiced in patent-leather boots on week-days, and
      marvellous made-up ties on Sundays&mdash;no man rebuking. McTurk was going
      up for Cooper's Hill, and Stalky for Sandhurst, in the spring; and the
      Head had told them both that, unless they absolutely collapsed during the
      holidays, they were safe. As a trainer of colts, the Head seldom erred in
      an estimate of form.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had taken Beetle aside that day and given him much good advice, not one
      word of which did Beetle remember when he dashed up to the study, white
      with excitement, and poured out the wondrous tale. It demanded a great
      belief.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You begin on a hundred a year?&rdquo; said McTurk unsympathetically. &ldquo;Rot!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And my passage out! It's all settled. The Head says he's been breaking me
      in for this for ever so long, and I never knew&mdash;I never knew. One
      don't begin with writing straight off, y'know. Begin by filling in
      telegrams and cutting things out o' papers with scissors.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Scissors! What an ungodly mess you'll make of it,&rdquo; said Stalky. &ldquo;But,
      anyhow, this will be your last term, too. Seven years, my dearly beloved
      'earers&mdash;though not prefects.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not half bad years, either,&rdquo; said McTurk. &ldquo;I shall be sorry to leave the
      old Coll.; shan't you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They looked out over the sea creaming along the Pebbleridge in the clear
      winter light. &ldquo;Wonder where we shall all be this time next year?&rdquo; said
      Stalky absently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This time five years,&rdquo; said McTurk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said Beetle, &ldquo;my leavin's between ourselves. The Head hasn't told
      any one. I know he hasn't, because Prout grunted at me to-day that if I
      were more reasonable&mdash;yah!&mdash;I might be a prefect next term. I
      s'ppose he's hard up for his prefects.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let's finish up with a row with the Sixth,&rdquo; suggested McTurk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dirty little schoolboys!&rdquo; said Stalky, who already saw himself a
      Sandhurst cadet. &ldquo;What's the use?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Moral effect,&rdquo; quoth McTurk. &ldquo;Leave an imperishable tradition, and all
      the rest of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Better go into Bideford an' pay up our debts,&rdquo; said Stalky. &ldquo;I've got
      three quid out of my father&mdash;<i>ad hoc</i>. Don't owe more than
      thirty bob, either. Cut along, Beetle, and ask the Head for leave. Say you
      want to correct the 'Swillingford Patriot.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I do,&rdquo; said Beetle. &ldquo;It'll be my last issue, and I'd like it to
      look decent. I'll catch him before he goes to his lunch.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ten minutes later they wheeled out in line, by grace released from five
      o'clock call-over, and all the afternoon lay before them. So also
      unluckily did King, who never passed without witticisms. But brigades of
      Kings could not have ruffled Beetle that day.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aha! Enjoying the study of light literature, my friends,&rdquo; said he,
      rubbing his hands. &ldquo;Common mathematics are not for such soaring minds as
      yours, are they?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      (&ldquo;One hundred a year,&rdquo; thought Beetle, smiling into vacancy.)
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our open incompetence takes refuge in the flowery paths of inaccurate
      fiction. But a day of reckoning approaches, Beetle mine. I myself have
      prepared a few trifling foolish questions in Latin prose which can hardly
      be evaded even by your practised acts of deception. Ye-es, Latin prose. I
      think, if I may say so&mdash;but we shall see when the papers are set&mdash;'Ulpian
      serves your need.' Aha! '<i>Elucescebat</i>, quoth our friend.' We shall
      see! We shall see!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Still no sign from Beetle. He was on a steamer, his passage paid into the
      wide and wonderful world&mdash;a thousand leagues beyond Lundy Island.
    </p>
    <p>
      King dropped him with a snarl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He doesn't know. He'll go on correctin' exercises an' jawin' an' showin'
      off before the little boys next term&mdash;and next.&rdquo; Beetle hurried after
      his companions up the steep path of the furze-clad hill behind the
      College.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were throwing pebbles on the top of the gasometer, and the grimy
      gas-man in change bade them desist. They watched him oil a turncock sunk
      in the ground between two furze-bushes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cokey, what's that for?&rdquo; said Stalky.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To turn the gas on to the kitchens,&rdquo; said Cokey. &ldquo;If so be I didn't turn
      her on, yeou young gen'lemen 'ud be larnin' your book by candlelight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Um!&rdquo; said Stalky, and was silent for at least a minute.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hullo! Where are you chaps going?&rdquo; A bend of the lane brought them face
      to face with Tulke, senior prefect of King's house&mdash;a smallish,
      white-haired boy, of the type that must be promoted on account of its
      intellect, and ever afterwards appeals to the Head to support its
      authority when zeal has outrun discretion.
    </p>
    <p>
      The three took no sort of notice. They were on lawful pass. Tulke repeated
      his question hotly, for he had suffered many slights from Number Five
      study, and fancied that he had at last caught them tripping.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What the devil is that to you?&rdquo; Stalky replied with his sweetest smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here, I'm not goin'&mdash;I'm not goin' to be sworn at by the
      Fifth!&rdquo; sputtered Tulke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then cut along and call a prefects' meeting,&rdquo; said McTurk, knowing
      Tulke's weakness.
    </p>
    <p>
      The prefect became inarticulate with rage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mustn't yell at the Fifth that way,&rdquo; said Stalky. &ldquo;It's vile bad form.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cough it up, ducky!&rdquo; McTurk said calmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I want to know what you chaps are doing out of bounds?&rdquo; This with
      an important flourish of his ground-ash.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said Stalky. &ldquo;Now we're gettin' at it. Why didn't you ask that
      before?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I ask it now. What are you doing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We're admiring you, Tulke,&rdquo; said Stalky. &ldquo;We think you're no end of a
      fine chap, don't we?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We do! We do!&rdquo; A dog-cart with some girls in it swept round the corner,
      and Stalky promptly kneeled before Tulke in the attitude of prayer; so
      Tulke turned a color.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've reason to believe&mdash;&rdquo; he began.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oyez! Oyez! Oyez!&rdquo; shouted Beetle, after the manner of Bideford's town
      crier, &ldquo;Tulke has reason to believe! Three cheers for Tulke!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They were given. &ldquo;It's all our giddy admiration,&rdquo; said Stalky. &ldquo;You know
      how we love you, Tulke. We love you so much we think you ought to go home
      and die. You're too good to live, Tulke.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said McTurk. &ldquo;Do oblige us by dyin'. Think how lovely you'd look
      stuffed!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Tulke swept up the road with an unpleasant glare in his eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That means a prefects' meeting&mdash;sure pop,&rdquo; said Stalky. &ldquo;Honor of
      the Sixth involved, and all the rest of it. Tulke'll write notes all this
      afternoon, and Carson will call us up after tea. They daren't overlook
      that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bet you a bob he follows us!&rdquo; said McTurk. &ldquo;He's King's pet, and it's
      scalps to both of 'em if we're caught out. We must be virtuous.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I move we go to Mother Yeo's for a last gorge. We owe her about ten
      bob, and Mary'll weep sore when she knows we're leaving,&rdquo; said Beetle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She gave me an awful wipe on the head last time&mdash;Mary,&rdquo; said Stalky.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She does if you don't duck,&rdquo; said McTurk. &ldquo;But she generally kisses one
      back. Let's try Mother Yeo.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They sought a little bottle-windowed half dairy, half restaurant, a
      dark-brewed, two-hundred-year-old house, at the head of a narrow side
      street. They had patronized it from the days of their fagdom, and were
      very much friends at home.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We've come to pay our debts, mother,&rdquo; said Stalky, sliding his arm round
      the fifty-six-inch waist of the mistress of the establishment. &ldquo;To pay our
      debts and say good-by&mdash;and&mdash;and we're awf'ly hungry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aie!&rdquo; said Mother Yeo, &ldquo;makkin' love to me! I'm shaamed of 'ee.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Rackon us wouldn't du no such thing if Mary was here,&rdquo; said McTurk,
      lapsing into the broad North Devon that the boys used on their campaigns.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who'm takin' my name in vain?&rdquo; The inner door opened, and Mary,
      fair-haired, blue-eyed, and apple-checked, entered with a bowl of cream in
      her hands. McTurk kissed her. Beetle followed suit, with exemplary calm.
      Both boys were promptly cuffed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Niver kiss the maid when 'e can kiss the mistress,&rdquo; said Stalky,
      shamelessly winking at Mother Yeo, as he investigated a shelf of jams.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Glad to see one of 'ee don't want his head slapped no more?&rdquo; said Mary
      invitingly, in that direction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Neu! Reckon I can get 'em give me,&rdquo; said Stalky, his back turned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not by me&mdash;yeou little masterpiece!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Niver asked 'ee. There's maids to Northam. Yiss&mdash;an' Appledore.&rdquo; An
      unreproducible sniff, half contempt, half reminiscence, rounded the
      retort.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aie! Yeou won't niver come to no good end. Whutt be 'baout, smellin' the
      cream?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Tees bad,&rdquo; said Stalky. &ldquo;Zmell 'un.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Incautiously Mary did as she was bid.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bidevoor kiss.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Niver amiss,&rdquo; said Stalky, taking it without injury.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yeou&mdash;yeou&mdash;yeou&mdash;&rdquo; Mary began, bubbling with mirth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They'm better to Northam&mdash;more rich, laike an' us gets them give
      back again,&rdquo; he said, while McTurk solemnly waltzed Mother Yeo out of
      breath, and Beetle told Mary the sad news, as they sat down to clotted
      cream, jam, and hot bread.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yiss. Yeou'll niver zee us no more, Mary. We're goin' to be passons an'
      missioners.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Steady the Buffs!&rdquo; said McTurk, looking through the blind. &ldquo;Tulke has
      followed us. He's comin' up the street now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They've niver put us out o' bounds,&rdquo; said Mother Yeo. &ldquo;Bide yeou still,
      my little dearrs.&rdquo; She rolled into the inner room to make the score.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mary,&rdquo; said Stalky, suddenly, with tragic intensity. &ldquo;Do 'ee lov' me,
      Mary?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Iss&mdash;fai! Talled 'ee zo since yeou was zo high!&rdquo; the damsel replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Zee 'un comin' up street, then?&rdquo; Stalky pointed to the unconscious Tulke.
      &ldquo;He've niver been kissed by no sort or manner o' maid in hees borned
      laife, Mary. Oh, 'tees shaamful!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whutt's to do with me? 'Twill come to 'un in the way o' nature, I
      rackon.&rdquo; She nodded her head sagaciously. &ldquo;You niver want me to kiss un&mdash;sure-<i>ly</i>?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give 'ee half-a-crown if 'ee will,&rdquo; said Stalky, exhibiting the coin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Half-a-crown was much to Mary Yeo, and a jest was more; but
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yeu'm afraid,&rdquo; said McTurk, at the psychological moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aie!&rdquo; Beetle echoed, knowing her weak point. &ldquo;There's not a maid to
      Northam 'ud think twice. An' yeou such a fine maid, tu!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      McTurk planted one foot firmly against the inner door lest Mother Yeo
      should return inopportunely, for Mary's face was set. It was then that
      Tulke found his way blocked by a tall daughter of Devon&mdash;that county
      of easy kisses, the pleasantest under the sun. He dodged aside politely.
      She reflected a moment, and laid a vast hand upon his shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where be 'ee gwaine tu, my dearr?&rdquo; said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      Over the handkerchief he had crammed into his mouth Stalky could see the
      boy turn scarlet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gie I a kiss! Don't they larn 'ee manners to College?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Tulke gasped and wheeled. Solemnly and conscientiously Mary kissed him
      twice, and the luckless prefect fled.
    </p>
    <p>
      She stepped into the shop, her eyes full of simple wonder. &ldquo;Kissed 'un?&rdquo;
       said Stalky, handing over the money.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Iss, fai! But, oh, my little body, he'm no Colleger. 'Zeemed tu-minded to
      cry, like.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, we won't. Yell couldn't make us cry that way,&rdquo; said McTurk. &ldquo;Try.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Whereupon Mary cuffed them all round.
    </p>
    <p>
      As they went out with tingling ears, said Stalky generally, &ldquo;Don't think
      there'll be much of a prefects' meeting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Won't there, just!&rdquo; said Beetle. &ldquo;Look here. If he kissed her&mdash;which
      is our tack&mdash;he is a cynically immoral hog, and his conduct is
      blatant indecency. <i>Confer orationes Regis furiosissimi</i>, when he
      collared me readin' 'Don Juan.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Course he kissed her,&rdquo; said McTurk. &ldquo;In the middle of the street. With
      his house-cap on!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Time, 3.57 p.m. Make a note o' that. What d'you mean, Beetle?&rdquo; said
      Stalky.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well! He's a truthful little beast. He may say he was kissed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, then!&rdquo; Beetle capered at the mere thought of it. &ldquo;Don't you see? The
      corollary to the giddy proposition is that the Sixth can't protect
      'emselves from outrages an' ravishin's. Want nursemaids to look after 'em!
      We've only got to whisper that to the Coll. Jam for the Sixth! Jam for us!
      Either way it's jammy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By Gum!&rdquo; said Stalky. &ldquo;Our last term's endin' well. Now you cut along an'
      finish up your old rag, and Turkey and me will help. We'll go in the back
      way. No need to bother Randall.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't play the giddy garden-goat, then?&rdquo; Beetle knew what help meant,
      though he was by no means averse to showing his importance before his
      allies. The little loft behind Randall's printing office was his own
      territory, where he saw himself already controlling the &ldquo;Times.&rdquo; Here,
      under the guidance of the inky apprentice, he had learned to find his way
      more or less circuitously about the case, and considered himself an expert
      compositor.
    </p>
    <p>
      The school paper in its locked formes lay on a stone-topped table, a proof
      by the side; but not for worlds would Beetle have corrected from the mere
      proof. With a mallet and a pair of tweezers, he knocked out mysterious
      wedges of wood that released the forme, picked a letter here and inserted
      a letter there, reading as he went along and stopping much to chuckle over
      his own contributions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You won't show off like that,&rdquo; said McTurk, &ldquo;when you've got to do it for
      your living. Upside down and backwards, isn't it? Let's see if I can read
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get out!&rdquo; said Beetle. &ldquo;Go and read those formes in the rack there, if
      you think you know so much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Formes in a rack! What's that? Don't be so beastly professional.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      McTurk drew off with Stalky to prowl about the office. They left little
      unturned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come here a shake, Beetle. What's this thing?&rdquo; aid Stalky, in a few
      minutes. &ldquo;Looks familiar.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Said Beetle, after a glance: &ldquo;It's King's Latin prose exam. paper. <i>In&mdash;In
      Varrem: actio prima</i>. What a lark!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Think o' the pure-souled, high-minded boys who'd give their eyes for a
      squint at it!&rdquo; said McTurk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Willie dear,&rdquo; said Stalky; &ldquo;that would be wrong and painful to our
      kind teachers. You wouldn't crib, Willie, would you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can't read the beastly stuff, anyhow,&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;Besides, we're
      leavin' at the end o' the term, so it makes no difference to us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Member what the Considerate Bloomer did to Spraggon's account of the
      Puffin'ton Hounds? We must sugar Mr. King's milk for him,&rdquo; said Stalky,
      all lighted from within by a devilish joy. &ldquo;Let's see what Beetle can do
      with those forceps he's so proud of.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't see now you can make Latin prose much more cock-eye than it is, but
      we'll try,&rdquo; said Beetle, transposing an <i>aliud</i> and <i>Asiae</i> from
      two sentences. &ldquo;Let's see! We'll put that full-stop a little further on,
      and begin the sentence with the next capital. Hurrah! Here's three lines
      that can move up all in a lump.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'One of those scientific rests for which this eminent huntsman is so
      justly celebrated.'&rdquo; Stalky knew the Puffington run by heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hold on! Here's a <i>vol</i>&mdash;<i>voluntate quidnam</i> all by
      itself,&rdquo; said McTurk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll attend to her in a shake. <i>Quidnam</i> goes after <i>Dolabella</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good old Dolabella,&rdquo; murmured Stalky. &ldquo;Don't break him. Vile prose Cicero
      wrote, didn't he? He ought to be grateful for&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hullo!&rdquo; said McTurk, over another forme. &ldquo;What price a giddy ode? <i>Qui</i>&mdash;<i>quis</i>&mdash;oh,
      it's <i>Quis multa gracilis</i>, o' course.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bring it along. We've sugared the milk here,&rdquo; said Stalky, after a few
      minutes' zealous toil. &ldquo;Never thrash your hounds unnecessarily.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Quis munditiis</i>? I swear that's not bad,&rdquo; began Beetle, plying the
      tweezers. &ldquo;Don't that interrogation look pretty? <i>Heu quoties fidem</i>!
      That sounds as if the chap were anxious an' excited. <i>Cui flavam religas
      in rosa</i>&mdash;Whose flavor is relegated to a rose. <i>Mutatosque Deos
      flebit in antro</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mute gods weepin' in a cave,&rdquo; suggested Stalky. &ldquo;'Pon my Sam, Horace
      needs as much lookin' after as&mdash;Tulke.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They edited him faithfully till it was too dark to see.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Aha! Elucescebat, quoth our friend.' Ulpian serves my need, does it? If
      King can make anything out of <i>that</i>, I'm a blue-eyed squatteroo,&rdquo;
       said Beetle, as they slid out of the loft window into a back alley of old
      acquaintance and started on a three-mile trot to the College. But the
      revision of the classics had detained them too long. They halted, blown
      and breathless, in the furze at the back of the gasometer, the College
      lights twinkling below, ten minutes at least late for tea and lock-up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's no good,&rdquo; puffed McTurk. &ldquo;Bet a bob Foxy is waiting for defaulters
      under the lamp by the Fives Court. It's a nuisance, too, because the Head
      gave us long leave, and one doesn't like to break it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Let me now from the bonded ware'ouse of my knowledge,'&rdquo; began Stalky.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, rot! Don't Jorrock. Can we make a run for it?&rdquo; snapped McTurk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Bishops' boots Mr. Radcliffe also condemned, an' spoke 'ighly in favor
      of tops cleaned with champagne an' abricot jam.' Where's that thing Cokey
      was twiddlin' this afternoon?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They heard him groping in the wet, and presently beheld a great miracle.
      The lights of the Coastguard cottages near the sea went out; the
      brilliantly illuminated windows of the Golf-club disappeared, and were
      followed by the frontages of the two hotels. Scattered villas dulled,
      twinkled, and vanished. Last of all, the College lights died also. They
      were left in the pitchy darkness of a windy winter's night.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Blister my kidneys. It <i>is</i> a frost. The dahlias are dead!'&rdquo; said
      Stalky. &ldquo;Bunk!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They squattered through the dripping gorse as the College hummed like an
      angry hive and the dining-rooms chorused, &ldquo;Gas! gas! gas!&rdquo; till they came
      to the edge of the sunk path that divided them from their study. Dropping
      that ha-ha like bullets, and rebounding like boys, they dashed to their
      study, in less than two minutes had changed into dry trousers and coat,
      and, ostentatiously slippered, joined the mob in the dining-hall, which
      resembled the storm-centre of a South American revolution.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Hellish dark and smells of cheese.'&rdquo; Stalky elbowed his way into the
      press, howling lustily for gas. &ldquo;Cokey must have gone for a walk. Foxy'll
      have to find him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Prout, as the nearest house-master, was trying to restore order, for rude
      boys were flicking butter-pats across chaos, and McTurk had turned on the
      fags' tea-urn, so that many were parboiled and wept with an unfeigned
      dolor. The Fourth and Upper Third broke into the school song, the &ldquo;Vive la
      Compagnie,&rdquo; to the accompaniment of drumming knife-handles; and the junior
      forms shrilled bat-like shrieks and raided one another's victuals. Two
      hundred and fifty boys in high condition, seeking for more light, are
      truly earnest inquirers.
    </p>
    <p>
      When a most vile smell of gas told them that supplies had been renewed,
      Stalky, waistcoat unbuttoned, sat gorgedly over what might have been his
      fourth cup of tea. &ldquo;And that's all right,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Hullo! 'Ere's
      Pomponius Ego!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was Carson, the head of the school, a simple, straight-minded soul, and
      a pillar of the First Fifteen, who crossed over from the prefects' table
      and in a husky, official voice invited the three to attend in his study in
      half an hour. &ldquo;Prefects' meetin'! Prefects' meetin'!&rdquo; hissed the tables,
      and they imitated barbarically the actions and effects of the ground-ash.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How are we goin' to jest with 'em?&rdquo; said Stalky, turning half-face to
      Beetle. &ldquo;It's your play this time!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; was the answer, &ldquo;all I want you to do is not to laugh. I'm
      goin' to take charge o' young Tulke's immorality&mdash;<i>a' la</i> King,
      and it's goin' to be serious. If you can't help laughin' don't look at me,
      or I'll go pop.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see. All right,&rdquo; said Stalky.
    </p>
    <p>
      McTurk's lank frame stiffened in every muscle and his eyelids dropped half
      over his eyes. That last was a war-signal.
    </p>
    <p>
      The eight or nine seniors, their faces very set and sober, were ranged in
      chairs round Carson's severely Philistine study. Tulke was not popular
      among them, and a few who had had experience of Stalky and Company doubted
      that he might, perhaps, have made an ass of himself. But the dignity of
      the Sixth was to be upheld. So Carson began hurriedly: &ldquo;Look here, you
      chaps, I've&mdash;we've sent for you to tell you you're a good deal too
      cheeky to the Sixth&mdash;have been for some time&mdash;and&mdash;and
      we've stood about as much as we're goin' to, and it seems you've been
      cursin' and swearin' at Tulke on the Bideford road this afternoon, and
      we're goin' to show you you can't do it. That's all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, that's awfully good of you,&rdquo; said Stalky, &ldquo;but we happen to have a
      few rights of our own, too. You can't, just because you happen to be made
      prefects, haul up seniors and jaw 'em on spec., like a house-master. We
      aren't fags, Carson. This kind of thing may do for Davies Tertius, but it
      won't do for us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's only old Prout's lunacy that we weren't prefects long ago. You know
      that,&rdquo; said McTurk. &ldquo;You haven't any tact.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hold on,&rdquo; said Beetle. &ldquo;A prefects' meetin' has to be reported to the
      Head. I want to know if the Head backs Tulke in this business?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;well, it isn't exactly a prefects' meeting,&rdquo; said Carson. &ldquo;We
      only called you in to warn you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But all the prefects are here,&rdquo; Beetle insisted. &ldquo;Where's the
      difference?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My Gum!&rdquo; said Stalky. &ldquo;Do you mean to say you've just called us in for a
      jaw&mdash;after comin' to us before the whole school at tea an' givin' 'em
      the impression it was a prefects' meeting? 'Pon my Sam, Carson, you'll get
      into trouble, you will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hole-an'-corner business&mdash;hole-an'-corner business,&rdquo; said McTurk,
      wagging his head. &ldquo;Beastly suspicious.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Sixth looked at each other uneasily. Tulke had called three prefects'
      meetings in two terms, till the Head had informed the Sixth that they were
      expected to maintain discipline without the recurrent menace of his
      authority. Now, it seemed that they had made a blunder at the outset, but
      any right-minded boy would have sunk the legality and been properly
      impressed by the Court. Beetle's protest was distinct &ldquo;cheek.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you chaps deserve a lickin',&rdquo; cried one Naughten incautiously. Then
      was Beetle filled with a noble inspiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For interferin' with Tulke's amours, eh?&rdquo; Tulke turned a rich sloe color.
      &ldquo;Oh, no, you don't!&rdquo; Beetle went on. &ldquo;You've had your innings. We've been
      sent up for cursing and swearing at you, and we're goin' to be let off
      with a warning! <i>Are</i> we? Now then, you're going to catch it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I&mdash;I&rdquo; Tulke began. &ldquo;Don't let that young devil start
      jawing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you've anything to say you must say it decently,'' said Carson.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Decently? I will. Now look here. When we went into Bideford we met this
      ornament of the Sixth&mdash;is that decent enough?&mdash;hanging about on
      the road with a nasty look in his eye. We didn't know <i>then</i> why he
      was so anxious to stop us, <i>but</i> at five minutes to four, when we
      were in Yeo's shop, we saw Tulke in broad daylight, with his house-cap on,
      kissin' an' huggin' a woman on the pavement. Is that decent enough for
      you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn't&mdash;I wasn't.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We saw you!&rdquo; said Beetle. &ldquo;And now&mdash;I'll be decent, Carson&mdash;you
      sneak back with her kisses&rdquo; (not for nothing had Beetle perused the later
      poets) &ldquo;hot on your lips and call prefects' meetings, which aren't
      prefects' meetings, to uphold the honor of the Sixth.&rdquo; A new and
      heaven-cleft path opened before him that instant. &ldquo;And how do we know,&rdquo; he
      shouted&mdash;&ldquo;how do we know how many of the Sixth are mixed up in this
      abominable affair?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, that's what we want to know,&rdquo; said McTurk, with simple dignity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We meant to come to you about it quietly, Carson, but you would have the
      meeting,&rdquo; said Stalky sympathetically.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Sixth were too taken aback to reply. So, carefully modelling his
      rhetoric on King, Beetle followed up the attack, surpassing and surprising
      himself, &ldquo;It&mdash;it isn't so much the cynical immorality of the biznai,
      as the blatant indecency of it, that's so awful. As far as we can see,
      it's impossible for us to go into Bideford without runnin' up against some
      prefect's unwholesome amours. There's nothing to snigger over, Naughten. I
      don't pretend to know much about these things&mdash;but it seems to me a
      chap must be pretty far dead in sin&rdquo; (that was a quotation from the school
      chaplain) &ldquo;when he takes to embracing his paramours&rdquo; (that was Hakluyt)
      &ldquo;before all the city&rdquo; (a reminiscence of Milton). &ldquo;He might at least have
      the decency&mdash;you're authorities on decency, I believe&mdash;to wait
      till dark. But he didn't. You didn't! Oh, Tulke. You&mdash;you incontinent
      little animal!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here, shut up a minute. What's all this about, Tulke?&rdquo; said Carson.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;look here. I'm awfully sorry. I never thought Beetle would take
      this line.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because&mdash;you've&mdash;no decency&mdash;you&mdash;thought&mdash;I
      hadn't,&rdquo; cried Beetle all in one breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tried to cover it all up with a conspiracy, did you?&rdquo; said Stalky.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Direct insult to all three of us,&rdquo; said McTurk. &ldquo;A most filthy mind you
      have, Tulke.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll shove you fellows outside the door if you go on like this,&rdquo; said
      Carson angrily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That proves it's a conspiracy,&rdquo; said Stalky, with the air of a virgin
      martyr.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I was goin' along the street&mdash;I swear I was,&rdquo; cried Tulke,
      &ldquo;and&mdash;and I'm awfully sorry about it&mdash;a woman came up and kissed
      me. I swear I didn't kiss her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a pause, filled by Stalky's long, liquid whistle of contempt,
      amazement, and derision.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On my honor,&rdquo; gulped the persecuted one. &ldquo;Oh, do stop him jawing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good,&rdquo; McTurk interjected. &ldquo;We are compelled, of course, to accept
      your statement.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Confound it!&rdquo; roared Naughten. &ldquo;You aren't head-prefect here, McTurk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, well,&rdquo; returned the Irishman, &ldquo;you know Tulke better than we do. I am
      only speaking for ourselves. <i>We</i> accept Tulke's word. But all I can
      say is that if I'd been collared in a similarly disgustin' situation, and
      had offered the same explanation Tulke has, I&mdash;I wonder what you'd
      have said. However, it seems on Tulke's word of honor&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Tulkus&mdash;beg pardon&mdash;<i>kiss</i>, of course&mdash;-Tulkiss
      is an honorable man,&rdquo; put in Stalky.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&mdash;that the Sixth can't protect 'emselves from bein' kissed when they
      go for a walk!&rdquo; cried Beetle, taking up the running with a rush. &ldquo;Sweet
      business, isn't it? Cheerful thing to tell the fags, ain't it? We aren't
      prefects, of course, but we aren't kissed very much. Don't think that sort
      of thing ever enters our heads; does it, Stalky?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no!&rdquo; said Stalky, turning aside to hide his emotions. McTurk's face
      merely expressed lofty contempt and a little weariness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you seem to know a lot about it,&rdquo; interposed a prefect.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can't help it&mdash;when you chaps shove it under our noses.&rdquo; Beetle
      dropped into a drawling parody of King's most biting colloquial style&mdash;the
      gentle rain after the thunder-storm. &ldquo;Well, it's all very sufficiently
      vile and disgraceful, isn't it? I don't know who comes out of it worst:
      Tulke, who happens to have been caught; or the other fellows who haven't.
      And we&mdash;&rdquo; here he wheeled fiercely on the other two&mdash;&ldquo;we've got
      to stand up and be jawed by them because we've disturbed their intrigues.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hang it! I only wanted to give you a word of warning,&rdquo; said Carson,
      thereby handing himself bound to the enemy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Warn? You?&rdquo; This with the air of one who finds loathsome gifts in his
      locker. &ldquo;Carson, would you be good enough to tell us what conceivable
      thing there is that you are entitled to warn us about after this exposure?
      Warn? Oh, it's a little too much! Let's go somewhere where it's clean.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The door banged behind their outraged innocence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Beetle! Beetle! Beetle! Golden Beetle!&rdquo; sobbed Stalky, hurling
      himself on Beetle's panting bosom as soon as they reached the study.
      &ldquo;However did you do it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear-r man&rdquo; said McTurk, embracing Beetle's head with both arms, while he
      swayed it to and fro on the neck, in time to this ancient burden&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   &ldquo;Pretty lips&mdash;sweeter than&mdash;cherry or plum.
   Always look&mdash;jolly and&mdash;never look glum;
   Seem to say&mdash;Come away. Kissy!&mdash;come, come!
   Yummy-yum! Yummy-yum! Yummy-yum-yum!&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look out. You'll smash my gig-lamps,&rdquo; puffed Beetle, emerging. &ldquo;Wasn't it
      glorious? Didn't I 'Eric' 'em splendidly? Did you spot my cribs from King?
      Oh, blow!&rdquo; His countenance clouded. &ldquo;There's one adjective I didn't use&mdash;obscene.
      Don't know how I forgot that. It's one of King's pet ones, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind. They'll be sendin' ambassadors round in half a shake to beg
      us not to tell the school. It's a deuced serious business for them,&rdquo; said
      McTurk. &ldquo;Poor Sixth&mdash;poor old Sixth!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Immoral young rips,&rdquo; Stalky snorted. &ldquo;What an example to pure-souled boys
      like you and me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And the Sixth in Carson's study sat aghast, glowering at Tulke, who was on
      the edge of tears. &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the head-prefect acidly. &ldquo;You've made a
      pretty average ghastly mess of it, Tulke.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why&mdash;why didn't you lick that young devil Beetle before he began
      jawing?&rdquo; Tulke wailed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knew there'd be a row,&rdquo; said a prefect of Prout's house. &ldquo;But you would
      insist on the meeting, Tulke.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and a fat lot of good it's done us,&rdquo; said Naughten. &ldquo;They come in
      here and jaw our heads off when we ought to be jawin' them. Beetle talks
      to us as if we were a lot of blackguards and&mdash;and all that. And when
      they've hung us up to dry, they go out and slam the door like a
      house-master. All your fault, Tulke.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I didn't kiss her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You ass! If you'd said you <i>had</i> and stuck to it, it would have been
      ten times better than what you did,&rdquo; Naughten retorted. &ldquo;Now they'll tell
      the whole school&mdash;and Beetle'll make up a lot of beastly rhymes and
      nick-names.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, hang it, she kissed me!&rdquo; Outside of his work, Tulke's mind moved
      slowly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm not thinking of you. I'm thinking of us. I'll go up to their study
      and see if I can make 'em keep quiet!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tulke's awf'ly cut up about this business,&rdquo; Naughten began,
      ingratiatingly, when he found Beetle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who's kissed him this time?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&mdash;and I've come to ask you chaps, and especially you, Beetle, not to
      let the thing be known all over the school. Of course, fellows as senior
      as you are can easily see why.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Um!&rdquo; said Beetle, with the cold reluctance of one who foresees an
      unpleasant public duty. &ldquo;I suppose I must go and talk to the Sixth again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not the least need, my dear chap, I assure you,&rdquo; said Naughten hastily.
      &ldquo;I'll take any message you care to send.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But the chance of supplying the missing adjective was too tempting. So
      Naughten returned to that still undissolved meeting, Beetle, white, icy,
      and aloof, at his heels.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There seems,&rdquo; he began, with laboriously crisp articulation, &ldquo;there seems
      to be a certain amount of uneasiness among you as to the steps we may
      think fit to take in regard to this last revelation of the&mdash;ah&mdash;obscene.
      If it is any consolation to you to know that we have decided&mdash;for the
      honor of the school, you understand&mdash;to keep our mouths shut as to
      these&mdash;ah&mdash;obscenities, you&mdash;ah&mdash;have it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He wheeled, his head among the stars, and strode statelily back to his
      study, where Stalky and McTurk lay side by side upon the table wiping
      their tearful eyes&mdash;too weak to move.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Latin prose paper was a success beyond their wildest dreams. Stalky
      and McTurk were, of course, out of all examinations (they did
      extra-tuition with the Head), but Beetle attended with zeal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This, I presume, is a par-ergon on your part,&rdquo; said King, as he dealt out
      the papers. &ldquo;One final exhibition ere you are translated to loftier
      spheres? A last attack on the classics? It seems to confound you already.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Beetle studied the print with knit brows. &ldquo;I can't make head or tail of
      it,&rdquo; he murmured. &ldquo;What does it mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no!&rdquo; said King, with scholastic coquetry. &ldquo;We depend upon you to give
      us the meaning. This is an examination, Beetle mine, not a
      guessing-competition. You will find your associates have no difficulty in&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Tulke left his place and laid the paper on the desk. King looked, read,
      and turned a ghastly green.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stalky's missing a heap,&rdquo; thought Beetle. &ldquo;Wonder how King'll get out of
      it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There seems,&rdquo; King began with a gulp, &ldquo;a certain modicum of truth in our
      Beetle's remark. I am&mdash;er&mdash;inclined to believe that the worthy
      Randall must have dropped this in ferule&mdash;if you know what that
      means. Beetle, you purport to be an editor. Perhaps you can enlighten the
      form as to formes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, sir! Whose form! I don't see that there's any verb in this sentence
      at all, an'&mdash;an'&mdash;the Ode is all different, somehow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was about to say, before you volunteered your criticism, that an
      accident must have befallen the paper in type, and that the printer reset
      it by the light of nature. No&mdash;&rdquo; he held the thing at arm's length&mdash;&ldquo;our
      Randall is not an authority on Cicero or Horace.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rather mean to shove it off on Randall,&rdquo; whispered Beetle to his
      neighbor. &ldquo;King must ha' been as screwed as an owl when he wrote it out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But we can amend the error by dictating it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir.&rdquo; The answer came pat from a dozen throats at once. &ldquo;That cuts
      the time for the exam. Only two hours allowed, sir. 'Tisn't fair. It's a
      printed-paper exam. How're we goin' to be marked for it! It's all
      Randall's fault. It isn't our fault, anyhow. An exam.'s an exam.,&rdquo; etc.,
      etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      Naturally Mr. King considered this was an attempt to undermine his
      authority, and, instead of beginning dictation at once, delivered a
      lecture on the spirit in which examinations should be approached. As the
      storm subsided, Beetle fanned it afresh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh? What? What was that you were saying to MacLagan?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I only said I thought the papers ought to have been looked at before they
      were given out, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hear, hear!&rdquo; from a back bench. Mr. King wished to know whether Beetle
      took it upon himself personally to conduct the traditions of the school.
      His zeal for knowledge ate up another fifteen minutes, during which the
      prefects showed unmistakable signs of boredom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it was a giddy time,&rdquo; said Beetle, afterwards, in dismantled Number
      Five. &ldquo;He gibbered a bit, and I kept him on the gibber, and then he
      dictated about a half of Dolabella &amp; Co.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good old Dolabella! Friend of mine. Yes?&rdquo; said Stalky, pensively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then we had to ask him how every other word was spelt, of course, and he
      gibbered a lot more. He cursed me and MacLagan (Mac played up like a
      trump) and Randall, and the 'materialized ignorance of the unscholarly
      middle classes,' 'lust for mere marks,' and all the rest. It was what you
      might call a final exhibition&mdash;a last attack&mdash;a giddy
      par-ergon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But o' course he was blind squiffy when he wrote the paper. I hope you
      explained that?&rdquo; said Stalky.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes. I told Tulke so. I said an immoral prefect an' a drunken
      house-master were legitimate inferences. Tulke nearly blubbed. He's
      awfully shy of us since Mary's time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Tulke preserved that modesty till the last moment&mdash;till the
      journey-money had been paid, and the boys were filling the brakes that
      took them to the station. Then the three tenderly constrained him to wait
      a while.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see, Tulke, you may be a prefect,&rdquo; said Stalky, &ldquo;but I've left the
      Coll. Do you see, Tulke, dear?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I see. Don't bear malice, Stalky.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stalky? Curse your impudence, you young cub,&rdquo; shouted Stalky, magnificent
      in top-hat, stiff collar, spats, and high-waisted, snuff-colored ulster.
      &ldquo;I want you to understand that <i>I'm</i> Mister Corkran, an' you're a
      dirty little schoolboy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Besides bein' frabjously immoral,&rdquo; said McTurk. &ldquo;Wonder you aren't
      ashamed to foist your company on pure-minded boys like us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come on, Tulke,' cried Naughten, from the prefects' brake.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, we're comin'. Shove up and make room, you Collegers. You've all got
      to be back next term, with your 'Yes, sir,' and 'Oh, sir,' an' 'No sir'
      an' 'Please sir'; but before we say good-by we're going to tell you a
      little story. Go on, Dickie&rdquo; (this to the driver); &ldquo;we're quite ready.
      Kick that hat-box under the seat, an' don't crowd your Uncle Stalky.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As nice a lot of high-minded youngsters as you'd wish to see,&rdquo; said
      McTurk, gazing round with bland patronage. &ldquo;A trifle immoral, but then&mdash;boys
      will be boys. It's no good tryin' to look stuffy, Carson. <i>Mister</i>
      Corkran will now oblige with the story of Tulke an' Mary Yeo!&rdquo;

      Part II.
    </h2>
    <p>
      That very Infant who told the story of the capture of Boh Na Ghee [<i>A
      Conference</i> <i>of the Powers</i>: &ldquo;Many Inventions&rdquo;] to Eustace
      Cleaver, novelist, inherited an estateful baronetcy, with vast revenues,
      resigned the service, and became a landholder, while his mother stood
      guard over him to see that he married the right girl. But, new to his
      position, he presented the local volunteers with a full-sized
      magazine-rifle range, two miles long, across the heart of his estate, and
      the surrounding families, who lived in savage seclusion among woods full
      of pheasants, regarded him as an erring maniac. The noise of the firing
      disturbed their poultry, and Infant was cast out from the society of
      J.P.'s and decent men till such time as a daughter of the county might
      lure him back to right thinking. He took his revenge by filling the house
      with choice selections of old schoolmates home on leave&mdash;affable
      detrimentals, at whom the bicycle-riding maidens of the surrounding
      families were allowed to look from afar. I knew when a troop-ship was in
      port by the Infant's invitations. Sometimes he would produce old friends
      of equal seniority; at others, young and blushing giants whom I had left
      small fags far down in the Lower Second; and to these Infant and the
      elders expounded the whole duty of man in the Army.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've had to cut the service,&rdquo; said the Infant; &ldquo;but that's no reason why
      my vast stores of experience should be lost to posterity.&rdquo; He was just
      thirty, and in that same summer an imperious wire drew me to his baronial
      castle: &ldquo;Got good haul; ex <i>Tamar</i>. Come along.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was an unusually good haul, arranged with a single eye to my benefit.
      There was a baldish, broken-down captain of Native Infantry, shivering
      with ague behind an indomitable red nose&mdash;and they called him Captain
      Dickson. There was another captain, also of Native Infantry, with a fair
      mustache; his face was like white glass, and his hands were fragile, but
      he answered joyfully to the cry of Tertius. There was an enormously big
      and well-kept man, who had evidently not campaigned for years,
      clean-shaved, soft-voiced, and cat-like, but still Abanazar for all that
      he adorned the Indian Political Service; and there was a lean Irishman,
      his face tanned blue-black with the suns of the Telegraph Department.
      Luckily the baize doors of the bachelors' wing fitted tight, for we
      dressed promiscuously in the corridor or in each other's rooms, talking,
      calling, shouting, and anon waltzing by pairs to songs of Dick Four's own
      devising.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were sixty years of mixed work to be sifted out between us, and
      since we had met one another from time to time in the quick scene-shifting
      of India&mdash;a dinner, camp, or a race-meeting here; a dak-bungalow or
      railway station up country somewhere else&mdash;we had never quite lost
      touch. Infant sat on the banisters, hungrily and enviously drinking it in.
      He enjoyed his baronetcy, but his heart yearned for the old days.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a cheerful babel of matters personal, provincial, and imperial,
      pieces of old call-over lists, and new policies, cut short by the roar of
      a Burmese gong, and we went down not less than a quarter of a mile of
      stairs to meet Infant's mother, who had known us all in our school-days
      and greeted us as if those had ended a week ago. But it was fifteen years
      since, with tears of laughter, she had lent me a gray princess-skirt for
      amateur theatricals.
    </p>
    <p>
      That was a dinner from the &ldquo;Arabian Nights,&rdquo; served in an eighty-foot hall
      full of ancestors and pots of flowering roses, and, what was more
      impressive, heated by steam. When it was ended and the little mother had
      gone away&mdash;(&ldquo;You boys want to talk, so I shall say good-night now&rdquo;)&mdash;we
      gathered about an apple-wood fire, in a gigantic polished steel grate,
      under a mantel-piece ten feet high, and the Infant compassed us about with
      curious liqueurs and that kind of cigarette which serves best to introduce
      your own pipe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, bliss!&rdquo; grunted Dick Four from a sofa, where he had been packed with
      a rug over him. &ldquo;First time I've been warm since I came home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We were all nearly on top of the fire, except Infant, who had been long
      enough at home to take exercise when he felt chilled. This is a grisly
      diversion, but much affected by the English of the Island.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you say a word about cold tubs and brisk walks,&rdquo; drawled McTurk, &ldquo;I'll
      kill you, Infant. I've got a liver, too. 'Member when we used to think it
      a treat to turn out of our beds on a Sunday morning&mdash;thermometer
      fifty-seven degrees if it was summer&mdash;and bathe off the Pebbleridge?
      Ugh!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Thing I don't understand,&rdquo; said Tertius, &ldquo;was the way we chaps used to
      go down into the lavatories, boil ourselves pink, and then come up with
      all our pores open into a young snow-storm or a black frost. Yet none of
      our chaps died, that I can remember.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Talkin' of baths,&rdquo; said McTurk, with a chuckle, &ldquo;'member our bath in
      Number Five, Beetle, the night Rabbits-Eggs rocked King? What wouldn't I
      give to see old Stalky now! He is the only one of the two Studies not
      here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stalky is the great man of his Century,&rdquo; said Dick Four.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How d'you know?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do I know?&rdquo; said Dick Four, scornfully. &ldquo;If you've ever been in a
      tight place with Stalky you wouldn't ask.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven't seen him since the camp at Pindi in '87,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;He was goin'
      strong then&mdash;about seven feet high and four feet through.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Adequate chap. Infernally adequate,&rdquo; said Tertius, pulling his mustache
      and staring into the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Got dam' near court-martialed and broke in Egypt in '84,&rdquo; the Infant
      volunteered. &ldquo;I went out in the same trooper with him&mdash;as raw as he
      was. Only <i>I</i> showed it, and Stalky didn't.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What was the trouble?&rdquo; said McTurk, reaching forward absently to twitch
      my dress-tie into position.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, nothing. His colonel trusted him to take twenty Tommies out to wash,
      or groom camels, or something at the back of Suakin, and Stalky got
      embroiled with Fuzzies five miles in the interior. He conducted a masterly
      retreat and wiped up eight of 'em. He knew jolly well he'd no right to go
      out so far, so he took the initiative and pitched in a letter to his
      colonel, who was frothing at the mouth, complaining of the 'paucity of
      support accorded to him in his operations.' Gad, it might have been one
      fat brigadier slangin' another! Then he went into the Staff Corps.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&mdash;is&mdash;entirely&mdash;Stalky,&rdquo; said Abanazar from his
      arm-chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You've come across him, too?&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; he replied in his softest tones. &ldquo;I was at the tail of that&mdash;that
      epic. Don't you chaps know?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We did not&mdash;Infant, McTurk, and I; and we called for information very
      politely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Twasn't anything,&rdquo; said Tertius. &ldquo;We got into a mess up in the
      Khye-Kheen Hills a couple o' years ago, and Stalky pulled us through.
      That's all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      McTurk gazed at Tertius with all an Irishman's contempt for the
      tongue-tied Saxon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heavens!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;And it's you and your likes govern Ireland. Tertius,
      aren't you ashamed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I can't tell a yarn. I can chip in when the other fellow starts <i>bukhing</i>.
      Ask him.&rdquo; He pointed to Dick Four, whose nose gleamed scornfully over the
      rug.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knew you wouldn't,&rdquo; said Dick Four. &ldquo;Give me a whiskey and soda. I've
      been drinking lemon-squash and ammoniated quinine while you chaps were
      bathin' in champagne, and my head's singin' like a top.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He wiped his ragged mustache above the drink; and, his teeth chattering in
      his head, began: &ldquo;You know the Khye-Kheen-Malot expedition, when we
      scared the souls out of 'em with a field force they daren't fight against?
      Well, both tribes&mdash;there was a coalition against us&mdash;came in
      without firing a shot; and a lot of hairy villains, who had no more power
      over their men than I had, promised and vowed all sorts of things. On that
      very slender evidence, Pussy dear&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was at Simla,&rdquo; said Abanazar, hastily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind, you're tarred with the same brush. On the strength of those
      tuppenny-ha'penny treaties, your asses of Politicals reported the country
      as pacified, and the Government, being a fool, as usual, began road-makin'&mdash;dependin'
      on local supply for labor. 'Member <i>that</i>, Pussy? 'Rest of our chaps
      who'd had no look-in during the campaign didn't think there'd be any more
      of it, and were anxious to get back to India. But I'd been in two of these
      little rows before, and I had my suspicions. I engineered myself, <i>summa
      ingenio</i>, into command of a road-patrol&mdash;no shovellin', only
      marching up and down genteelly with a guard. They'd withdrawn all the
      troops they could, but I nucleused about forty Pathans, recruits chiefly,
      of my regiment, and sat tight at the base-camp while the road-parties went
      to work, as per Political survey.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Had some rippin' sing-songs in camp, too,&rdquo; said Tertius.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My pup&rdquo;&mdash;thus did Dick Four refer to his subaltern&mdash;&ldquo;was a
      pious little beast. He didn't like the sing-songs, and so he went down
      with pneumonia. I rootled round the camp, and found Tertius gassing about
      as a D.A.Q.M.G., which, God knows, he isn't cut out for. There were six or
      eight of the old Coll. at base-camp (we're always in force for a frontier
      row), but I'd heard of Tertius as a steady old hack, and I told him he had
      to shake off his D.A.Q.M.G. breeches and help <i>me</i>. Tertius
      volunteered like a shot, and we settled it with the authorities, and out
      we went&mdash;forty Pathans, Tertius, and me, looking up the road-parties.
      Macnamara's&mdash;'member old Mac, the Sapper, who played the fiddle so
      damnably at Umballa?&mdash;Mac's party was the last but one. The last was
      Stalky's. He was at the head of the road with some of his pet Sikhs. Mac
      said he believed he was all right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stalky <i>is</i> a Sikh,&rdquo; said Tertius. &ldquo;He takes his men to pray at the
      Durbar Sahib at Amritzar, regularly as clockwork, when he can.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't interrupt, Tertius. It was about forty miles beyond Mac's before I
      found him; and my men pointed out gently, but firmly, that the country was
      risin'. What kind o' country, Beetle? Well, <i>I</i>'m no word-painter,
      thank goodness, but <i>you</i> might call it a hellish country! When we
      weren't up to our necks in snow, we were rolling down the khud. The
      well-disposed inhabitants, who were to supply labor for the road-making
      (don't forget that, Pussy dear), sat behind rocks and took pot-shots at
      us. 'Old, old story! We all legged it in search of Stalky. I had a feeling
      that he'd be in good cover, and about dusk we found him and his
      road-party, as snug as a bug in a rug, in an old Malot stone fort, with a
      watch-tower at one corner. It overhung the road they had blasted out of
      the cliff fifty feet below; and under the road things went down pretty
      sheer, for five or six hundred feet, into a gorge about half a mile wide
      and two or three miles long. There were chaps on the other side of the
      gorge scientifically gettin' our range. So I hammered on the gate and
      nipped in, and tripped over Stalky in a greasy, bloody old poshteen,
      squatting on the ground, eating with his men. I'd only seen him for half a
      minute about three months before, but I might have met him yesterday. He
      waved his hand all sereno.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Hullo, Aladdin! Hullo, Emperor!' he said. 'You're just in time for the
      performance.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I saw his Sikhs looked a bit battered. 'Where's your command? Where's
      your subaltern?' I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Here&mdash;all there is of it,' said Stalky. 'If you want young Everett,
      he's dead, and his body's in the watch-tower. They rushed our road-party
      last week, and got him and seven men. We've been besieged for five days. I
      suppose they let you through to make sure of you. The whole country's up.
      'Strikes me you've walked into a first-class trap.' He grinned, but
      neither Tertius nor I could see where the deuce the fun was. We hadn't any
      grub for our men, and Stalky had only four days' whack for his. That came
      of dependin' upon your asinine Politicals, Pussy dear, who told us that
      the inhabitants were friendly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To make us <i>quite</i> comfy, Stalky took us up to the watch-tower to
      see poor Everett's body, lyin' in a foot o' drifted snow. It looked like a
      girl of fifteen&mdash;not a hair on the little fellow's face. He'd been
      shot through the temple, but the Malots had left their mark on him.
      Stalky unbuttoned the tunic, and showed it to us&mdash;a rummy
      sickle-shaped cut on the chest. 'Member the snow all white on his
      eyebrows, Tertius? 'Member when Stalky moved the lamp and it looked as if
      he was alive?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ye-es,&rdquo; said Tertius, with a shudder. &ldquo;'Member the beastly look on
      Stalky's face, though, with his nostrils all blown out, same as he used to
      look when he was bullyin' a fag? That was a lovely evening.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We held a council of war up there over Everett's body. Stalky said the
      Malots and Khye-Kheens were up together; havin' sunk their blood feuds to
      settle us. The chaps we'd seen across the gorge were Khye-Kheens. It was
      about half a mile from them to us as a bullet flies, and they'd made a
      line of sungars under the brow of the hill to sleep in and starve us out.
      The Malots, he said, were in front of us promiscuous. There wasn't good
      cover behind the fort, or they'd have been there, too. Stalky didn't mind
      the Malots half as much as he did the Khye-Kheens. He said the Malots
      were treacherous curs. What I couldn't understand was, why in the world
      the two gangs didn't join in and rush us. There must have been at least
      five hundred of 'em. Stalky said they didn't trust each other very well,
      because they were ancestral enemies when they were at home; and the only
      time they'd tried a rush he'd hove a couple of blasting-charges among 'em,
      and that had sickened 'em a bit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was dark by the time we finished, and Stalky, always serene, said:
      'You command now. I don't suppose you mind my taking any action I may
      consider necessary to reprovision the fort?' I said, 'Of course not,' and
      then the lamp blew out. So Tertius and I had to climb down the tower steps
      (we didn't want to stay with Everett) and got back to our men. Stalky had
      gone off&mdash;to count the stores, I supposed. Anyhow, Tertius and I sat
      up in case of a rush (they were plugging at us pretty generally, you
      know), relieving each other till the mornin'.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mornin' came. No Stalky. Not a sign of him. I took counsel with his
      senior native officer&mdash;a grand, white-whiskered old chap&mdash;Rutton
      Singh, from Jullunder-way. He only grinned, and said it was all right.
      Stalky had been out of the fort twice before, somewhere or other,
      accordin' to him. He said Stalky 'ud come back unchipped, and gave me to
      understand that Stalky was an invulnerable <i>Guru</i> of sorts. All the
      same, I put the whole command on half rations, and set 'em to pickin' out
      loopholes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About noon there was no end of a snow-storm, and the enemy stopped
      firing. We replied gingerly, because we were awfully short of ammunition.
      Don't suppose we fired five shots an hour, but we generally got our man.
      Well, while I was talking with Rutton Singh I saw Stalky coming down from
      the watch-tower, rather puffy about the eyes, his poshteen coated with
      claret-colored ice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'No trustin' these snow-storms,' he said. 'Nip out quick and snaffle what
      you can get. There's a certain amount of friction between the Khye-Kheens
      and the Malots just now.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I turned Tertius out with twenty Pathans, and they bucked about in the
      snow for a bit till they came on to a sort of camp about eight hundred
      yards away, with only a few men in charge and half a dozen sheep by the
      fire. They finished off the men, and snaffled the sheep and as much grain
      as they could carry, and came back. No one fired a shot at 'em. There
      didn't seem to be anybody about, but the snow was falling pretty thick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'That's good enough,' said Stalky when we got dinner ready and he was
      chewin' mutton-kababs off a cleanin' rod. 'There's no sense riskin' men.
      They're holding a pow-wow between the Khye-Kheens and the Malots at the
      head of the gorge. I don't think these so-called coalitions are much
      good.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know what that maniac had done? Tertius and I shook it out of him
      by instalments. There was an underground granary cellar-room below the
      watch-tower, and in blasting the road Stalky had blown a hole into one
      side of it. Being no one else <i>but</i> Stalky, he'd kept the hole open
      for his own ends; and laid poor Everett's body slap over the well of the
      stairs that led down to it from the watch-tower. He'd had to move and
      replace the corpse every time he used the passage. The Sikhs wouldn't go
      near the place, of course. Well, he'd got out of this hole, and dropped on
      to the road. Then, in the night <i>and</i> a howling snow-storm, he'd
      dropped over the edge of the khud, made his way down to the bottom of the
      gorge, forded the nullah, which was half frozen, climbed up on the other
      side along a track he'd discovered, and come out on the right flank of the
      Khye-Kheens. He had then&mdash;listen to this!&mdash;crossed over a ridge
      that paralleled their rear, walked half a mile behind that, and come out
      on the left of their line where the gorge gets shallow and where there was
      a regular track between the Malot and the Khye-Kheen camps. That was
      about two in the morning, and, as it turned out, a man spotted him&mdash;a
      Khye-Kheen. So Stalky abolished him quietly, and left him&mdash;<i>with</i>
      the Malot mark on his chest, same as Everett had.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'I was just as economical as I could be,' Stalky said to us. 'If he'd
      shouted I should have been slain. I'd never had to do that kind of thing
      but once before, and that was the first time I tried that path. It's
      perfectly practicable for infantry, you know.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'What about your first man?' I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Oh, that was the night after they killed Everett, and I went out lookin'
      for a line of retreat for my men. A man found me. I abolished him&mdash;<i>privatim</i>&mdash;scragged
      him. But on thinkin' it over it occurred to me that if I could find the
      body (I'd hove it down some rocks) I might decorate it with the Malot
      mark and leave it to the Khye-Kheens to draw inferences. So I went out
      again the next night and did. The Khye-Kheens are shocked at the Malots
      perpetratin' these two dastardly outrages after they'd sworn to sink all
      bleed feuds. I lay up behind their sungars early this morning and watched
      'em. They all went to confer about it at the head of the gorge. Awf'ly
      annoyed they are. Don't wonder.' You know the way Stalky drops out his
      words, one by one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My God!&rdquo; said the Infant, explosively, as the full depth of the strategy
      dawned on him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear-r man!&rdquo; said McTurk, purring rapturously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stalky stalked,&rdquo; said Tertius. &ldquo;That's all there is to it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, he didn't,&rdquo; said Dick Four. &ldquo;Don't you remember how he insisted that
      he had only applied his luck? Don't you remember how Rutton Singh grabbed
      his boots and grovelled in the snow, and how our men shouted?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;None of our Pathans believed that was luck,&rdquo; said Tertius. &ldquo;They swore
      Stalky ought to have been born a Pathan, and&mdash;'member we nearly had a
      row in the fort when Rutton Singh said Stalky was a Pathan? Gad, how
      furious the old chap was with my Jemadar! But Stalky just waggled his
      finger and they shut up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Old Rutton Singh's sword was half out, though, and he swore he'd cremate
      every Khye-Kheen and Malot he killed. That made the Jemadar pretty wild,
      because he didn't mind fighting against his own creed, but he wasn't going
      to crab a fellow Mussulman's chances of Paradise. Then Stalky jabbered
      Pushtu and Punjabi in alternate streaks. Where the deuce did he pick up
      his Pushtu from, Beetle?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind his language, Dick,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;Give us the gist of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I flatter myself I can address the wily Pathan on occasion, but, hang it
      all, I can't make puns in Pushtu, or top off my arguments with a smutty
      story, as he did. He played on those two old dogs o' war like a&mdash;like
      a concertina. Stalky said&mdash;and the other two backed up his knowledge
      of Oriental nature&mdash;that the Khye-Kheens and the Malots between 'em
      would organize a combined attack on us that night, as a proof of good
      faith. They wouldn't drive it home, though, because neither side would
      trust the other on account, as Rutton Singh put it, of the little
      accidents. Stalky's notion was to crawl out at dusk with his Sikhs,
      manoeuvre 'em along this ungodly goat-track that he'd found, to the back
      of the Khye-Kheen position, and then lob in a few long shots at the
      Malots when the attack was well on. 'That'll divert their minds and help
      to agitate 'em,' he said. 'Then you chaps can come out and sweep up the
      pieces, and we'll rendezvous at the head of the gorge. After that, I move
      we get back to Mac's camp and have something to eat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>You</i> were commandin'?&rdquo; the Infant suggested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was about three months senior to Stalky, and two months Tertius's
      senior,&rdquo; Dick Four replied. &ldquo;<i>But</i> we were all from the same old
      Coll. I should say ours was the only little affair on record where some
      one wasn't jealous of some one else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>We</i> weren't,&rdquo; Tertius broke in, &ldquo;but there was another row between
      Gul Sher Khan and Rutton Singh. Our Jemadar said&mdash;he was quite right&mdash;that
      no Sikh living could stalk worth a damn; and that Koran Sahib had better
      take out the Pathans, who understood that kind of mountain work. Rutton
      Singh said that Koran Sahib jolly well knew every Pathan was a born
      deserter, and every Sikh was a gentleman, even if he couldn't crawl on his
      belly. Stalky struck in with some woman's proverb or other, that had the
      effect of doublin' both men up with a grin. He said the Sikhs and the
      Pathans could settle their claims on the Khye-Kheens and Malots later on,
      but he was going to take his Sikhs along for this mountain-climbing job,
      because Sikhs could shoot. They can, too. Give 'em a mule-load of
      ammunition apiece, and they're perfectly happy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And out he gat,&rdquo; said Dick Four. &ldquo;As soon as it was dark, and he'd had a
      bit of a snooze, him and thirty Sikhs went down through the staircase in
      the tower, every mother's son of 'em salutin' little Everett where It
      stood propped up against the wall. The last I heard him say was,
      'Kubbadar! tumbleinga! [Look out; you'll fall!] and they tumbleingaed over
      the black edge of nothing. Close upon 9 p.m. the combined attack
      developed; Khye-Kheens across the valley, and Malots in front of us,
      pluggin' at long range and yellin' to each other to come along and cut our
      infidel throats. Then they skirmished up to the gate, and began the old
      game of calling our Pathans renegades, and invitin' 'em to join the holy
      war. One of our men, a young fellow from Dera Ismail, jumped on the wall
      to slang 'em back, and jumped down, blubbing like a child. He'd been hit
      smack in the middle of the hand. 'Never saw a man yet who could stand a
      hit in the hand without weepin' bitterly. It tickles up all the nerves. So
      Tertius took his rifle and smote the others on the head to keep them quiet
      at the loopholes. The dear children wanted to open the gate and go in at
      'em generally, but that didn't suit our book.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At last, near midnight, I heard the wop, wop, wop, of Stalky's Martinis
      across the valley, and some general cursing among the Malots, whose main
      body was hid from us by a fold in the hillside. Stalky was brownin' 'em at
      a great rate, and very naturally they turned half right and began to blaze
      at their faithless allies, the Khye-Kheens&mdash;regular volley firin'. In
      less than ten minutes after Stalky opened the diversion they were going it
      hammer and tongs, both sides the valley. When we could see, the valley was
      rather a mixed-up affair. The Khye-Kheens had streamed out of their
      sungars above the gorge to chastise the Malots, and Stalky&mdash;I was
      watching him through my glasses&mdash;had slipped in behind 'em. Very
      good. The Khye-Kheens had to leg it along the hillside up to where the
      gorge got shallow and they could cross over to the Malots, who were
      awfully cheered to see the Khye-Kheens taken in the rear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then it occurred to me to comfort the Khye-Kheens. So I turned out the
      whole command, and we advanced <i>a' la pas de charge</i>, doublin' up
      what, for the sake of argument, we'll call the Malots' left flank. Even
      then, if they'd sunk their differences, they could have eaten us alive;
      but they'd been firin' at each other half the night, and they went on
      firin'. Queerest thing you ever saw in your born days! As soon as our men
      doubled up to the Malots, they'd blaze at the Khye-Kheens more zealously
      than ever, to show they were on our side, run up the valley a few hundred
      yards, and halt to fire again. The moment Stalky saw our game he
      duplicated it his side the gorge; and, by Jove! the Khye-Kheens did just
      the same thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but,&rdquo; said Tertius, &ldquo;you've forgot him playin' 'Arrah, Patsy, mind
      the baby' on the bugle to hurry us up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did he?&rdquo; roared McTurk. Somehow we all began to sing it, and there was an
      interruption.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rather,&rdquo; said Tertius, when we were quiet. No one of the Aladdin company
      could forget that tune. &ldquo;Yes, he played 'Patsy.' Go on, Dick.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Finally,&rdquo; said Dick Four, &ldquo;we drove both mobs into each other's arms on a
      bit of level ground at the head of the valley, and saw the whole crew
      whirl off, fightin' and stabbin' and swearin' in a blindin' snow-storm.
      They were a heavy, hairy lot, and we didn't follow 'em.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stalky had captured one prisoner&mdash;an old pensioned Sepoy of
      twenty-five years' service, who produced his discharge&mdash;an awf'ly
      sportin' old card. He had been tryin' to make his men rush us early in the
      day. He was sulky&mdash;angry with his own side for their cowardice, and
      Rutton Singh wanted to bayonet him&mdash;Sikhs don't understand fightin'
      against the Government after you've served it honestly&mdash;but Stalky
      rescued him, and froze on to him tight&mdash;with ulterior motives, I
      believe. When we got back to the fort, we buried young Everett&mdash;Stalky
      wouldn't hear of blowin' up the place&mdash;and bunked. We'd only lost ten
      men, all told.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only ten, out of seventy. How did you lose 'em?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, there was a rush on the fort early in the night, and a few Malots
      got over the gate. It was rather a tight thing for a minute or two, but
      the recruits took it beautifully. Lucky job we hadn't any badly wounded
      men to carry, because we had forty miles to Macnamara's camp. By Jove, how
      we legged it! Half way in, old Rutton Singh collapsed, so we slung him
      across four rifles and Stalky's overcoat; and Stalky, his prisoner, and a
      couple of Sikhs were his bearers. After that I went to sleep. You can, you
      know, on the march, when your legs get properly numbed. Mac swears we all
      marched into his camp snoring and dropped where we halted. His men lugged
      us into the tents like gram-bags. I remember wakin' up and seeing Stalky
      asleep with his head on old Rutton Singh's chest. <i>He</i> slept
      twenty-four hours. I only slept seventeen, but then I was coming down with
      dysentery.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Coming down? What rot! He had it on him before we joined Stalky in the
      fort,&rdquo; said Tertius.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, <i>you</i> needn't talk! You hove your sword at Macnamara and
      demanded a drum-head court-martial every time you saw him. The only thing
      that soothed you was putting you under arrest every half hour. You were
      off your head for three days.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't remember a word of it,&rdquo; said Tertius, placidly. &ldquo;I remember my
      orderly giving me milk, though.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How did Stalky come out?&rdquo; McTurk demanded, purling hard over his pipe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stalky? Like a serene Brahmini bull. Poor old Mac was at his Royal
      Engineers' wits' end to know what to do. You see I was putrid with
      dysentery, Tertius was ravin', half the men had frost-bite, and
      Macnamara's orders were to break camp and come in before winter. So
      Stalky, who hadn't turned a hair, took half his supplies to save him the
      bother o' luggin' 'em back to the plains, and all the ammunition he could
      get at, and, <i>consilio et auxilio</i> Rutton Singhi, tramped back to his
      fort with all his Sikhs and his precious prisoners, and a lot of dissolute
      hangers-on that he and the prisoner had seduced into service. He had sixty
      men of sorts&mdash;and his brazen cheek. Mac nearly wept with joy when he
      went. You see there weren't any explicit orders to Stalky to come in
      before the passes were blocked: Mac is a great man for orders, and
      Stalky's a great man for orders&mdash;when they suit his book.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He told me he was goin' to the Engadine,&rdquo; said Tertius. &ldquo;Sat on my cot
      smokin' a cigarette, and makin' me laugh till I cried. Macnamara bundled
      the whole lot of us down to the plains next day. We were a walkin'
      hospital.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stalky told me that Macnamara was a simple godsend to him,&rdquo; said Dick
      Four. &ldquo;I used to see him in Mac's tent listenin' to Mac playin' the
      fiddle, and, between the pieces, wheedlin' Mac out of picks and shovels
      and dynamite cartridges hand-over-fist. Well, that was the last we saw of
      Stalky. A week or so later the passes were shut with snow, and I don't
      think Stalky wanted to be found particularly just then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He didn't,&rdquo; said the fair and fat Abanazar. &ldquo;He didn't. Ho, ho!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dick Four threw up his thin, dry hand with the blue veins at the back of
      it. &ldquo;Hold on a minute, Pussy; I'll let you in at the proper time. I went
      down to my regiment, and that spring, five mouths later, I got off with a
      couple of companies on detachment: nominally to look after some friends of
      ours across the border; actually, of course, to recruit. It was a bit
      unfortunate, because an ass of a young Naick carried a frivolous
      blood-feud he'd inherited from his aunt into those hills, and the local
      gentry wouldn't volunteer into my corps. Of course, the Naick had taken
      short leave to manage the business; that was all regular enough; <i>but</i>
      he'd stalked my pet orderly's uncle. It was an infernal shame, because I
      knew Harris of the Ghuznees would be covering that ground three months
      later, and he'd snaffle all the chaps I had my eyes on. Everybody was down
      on the Naick, because they felt he ought to have had the decency to
      postpone his&mdash;his disgustful amours till our companies were full
      strength.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Still the beast had a certain amount of professional feeling left. He
      sent one of his aunt's clan by night to tell me that, if I'd take
      safeguard, he'd put me on to a batch of beauties. I nipped over the border
      like a shot, and about ten miles the other side, in a nullah, my
      rapparee-in-charge showed me about seventy men variously armed, but
      standing up like a Queen's company. Then one of 'em stepped out and lugged
      round an old bugle, just like&mdash;who's the man?&mdash;Bancroft, ain't
      it?&mdash;feeling for his eye-glass in a farce, and played 'Arrah, Patsy,
      mind the baby. Arrah, Patsy, mind'&mdash;that was as for as he could get.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That, also, was as far as Dick Four could get, because we had to sing the
      old song through twice, again and once more, and subsequently, in order to
      repeat it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He explained that if I knew the rest of the song he had a note for me
      from the man the song belonged to. Whereupon, my children, I finished that
      old tune on that bugle, and <i>this</i> is what I got. I knew you'd like
      to look at it. Don't grab.&rdquo; (We were all struggling for a sight of the
      well-known unformed handwriting.) &ldquo;I'll read it aloud.

     &ldquo;'Fort Everett, February 19.
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Dear Dick, or Tertius: The bearer of this is in charge of seventy-five
      recruits, all pukka devils, but desirous of leading new lives. They have
      been slightly polished, and after being boiled may shape well. I want you
      to give thirty of them to my adjutant, who, though God's own ass, will
      need men this spring. The rest you can keep. You will be interested to
      learn that I have extended my road to the end of the Malot country. All
      headmen and priests concerned in last September's affair worked one month
      each, supplying road metal from their own houses. Everett's grave is
      covered by a forty-foot mound, which should serve well as a base for
      future triangulations. Rutton Singh sends his best salaams. I am making
      some treaties, and have given my prisoner&mdash;who also sends his salaams&mdash;local
      rank of Khan Bahadur. &ldquo;'A. L. Cockran.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, that was all,&rdquo; said Dick Four, when the roaring, the shouting, the
      laughter, and, I think, the tears, had subsided. &ldquo;I chaperoned the gang
      across the border as quick as I could. They were rather homesick, but they
      cheered up when they recognized some of my chaps, who had been in the
      Khye-Kheen row, and they made a rippin' good lot. It's rather more than
      three hundred miles from Fort Everett to where I picked 'em up. Now,
      Pussy, tell 'em the latter end o' Stalky as you saw it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Abanazar laughed a little nervous, misleading, official laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it wasn't much. I was at Simla in the spring, when our Stalky, out of
      his snows, began corresponding direct with the Government.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After the manner of a king,&rdquo; suggested Dick Four. &ldquo;My turn now, Dick.
      He'd done a whole let of things he shouldn't have done, and constructively
      pledged the Government to all sorts of action.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Pledged the State's ticker, eh?&rdquo; said McTurk, with a nod to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About that; but the embarrassin' part was that it was all so thunderin'
      convenient, so well reasoned, don't you know? Came in as pat as if he'd
      had access to all sorts of information&mdash;which he couldn't, of
      course.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pooh!&rdquo; said Tertius, &ldquo;I back Stalky against the Foreign Office any day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He'd done pretty nearly everything he could think of, except strikin'
      coins in his own image and superscription, all under cover of buildin'
      this infernal road and bein' blocked by the snow. His report was simply
      amazin'. Von Lennaert tore his hair over it at first, and then he gasped,
      'Who the dooce is this unknown Warren Hastings? He must be slain. He must
      be slain officially! The Viceroy'll never stand it. It's unheard of. He
      must be slain by his Excellency in person. Order him up here and pitch in
      a stinger.' Well, I sent him no end of an official stinger, and I pitched
      in an unofficial telegram at the same time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You!&rdquo; This with amazement from the Infant, for Abanazar resembled nothing
      so much as a fluffy Persian cat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;me,&rdquo; said Abanazar. &ldquo;'Twasn't much, but after what you've said,
      Dicky, it was rather a coincidence, because I wired:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   &ldquo;'Aladdin now has got his wife,
   Your Emperor is appeased.
   I think you'd better come to life:
   We hope you've all been pleased.'
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Funny how that old song came up in my head. That was fairly non-committal
      and encouragin'. The only flaw was that his Emperor wasn't appeased by
      very long chalks. Stalky extricated himself from his mountain fastnesses
      and leafed up to Simla at his leisure, to be offered up on the horns of
      the altar.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; I began, &ldquo;surely the Commander-in-Chief is the proper&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His Excellency had an idea that if he blew up one single junior captain&mdash;same
      as King used to blow us up&mdash;he was holdin' the reins of empire, and,
      of course, as long as he had that idea, Von Lennaert encouraged him. I'm
      not sure Von Lennaert didn't put that notion into his head.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They've changed the breed, then, since my time,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;P'r'aps. Stalky was sent up for his wiggin' like a bad little boy. I've
      reason to believe that His Excellency's hair stood on end. He walked into
      Stalky for one hour&mdash;Stalky at attention in the middle of the floor,
      and (so he vowed) Von Lennaert pretending to soothe down His Excellency's
      topknot in dumb show in the background. Stalky didn't dare to look up, or
      he'd have laughed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, wherefore was Stalky not broken publicly?&rdquo; said the Infant, with a
      large and luminous leer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, wherefore?&rdquo; said Abanazar. &ldquo;To give him a chance to retrieve his
      blasted career, and not to break his father's heart. Stalky hadn't a
      father, but that didn't matter. He behaved like a&mdash;like the Sanawar
      Orphan Asylum, and His Excellency graciously spared him. Then he came
      round to my office and sat opposite me for ten minutes, puffing out his
      nostrils. Then he said, 'Pussy, if I thought that basket-hanger&mdash;'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hah! He remembered that,&rdquo; said McTurk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'That two-anna basket-hanger governed India, I swear I'd become a
      naturalized Muscovite to-morrow. I'm a <i>femme incomprise</i>. This
      thing's broken my heart. It'll take six months' shootin'-leave in India to
      mend it. Do you think I can get it, Pussy?'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He got it in about three minutes and a half, and seventeen days later he
      was back in the arms of Rutton Singh&mdash;horrid disgraced&mdash;with
      orders to hand over his command, etc., to Cathcart MacMonnie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Observe!&rdquo; said Dick Four. &ldquo;One colonel of the Political Department in
      charge of thirty Sikhs, on a hilltop. Observe, my children!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Naturally, Cathcart not being a fool, even if he <i>is</i> a Political,
      let Stalky do his shooting within fifteen miles of Fort Everett for the
      next six months, and I always understood they and Rutton Singh and the
      prisoner were as thick as thieves. Then Stalky loafed back to his
      regiment, I believe. I've never seen him since.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have, though,&rdquo; said McTurk, swelling with pride.
    </p>
    <p>
      We all turned as one man. &ldquo;It was at the beginning of this hot weather. I
      was in camp in the Jullunder doab and stumbled slap on Stalky in a Sikh
      village; sitting on the one chair of state, with half the population
      grovellin' before him, a dozen Sikh babies on his knees, an old harridan
      clappin' him on the shoulder, and a garland o' flowers round his neck.
      Told me he was recruitin'. We dined together that night, but he never said
      a word of the business at the Fort. Told me, though, that if I wanted any
      supplies I'd better say I was Koran Sahib's <i>bhai</i>; and I did, and
      the Sikhs wouldn't take my money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! That must have been one of Rutton Singh's villages,&rdquo; said Dick Four;
      and we smoked for some time in silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say,&rdquo; said McTurk, casting back through the years, &ldquo;did Stalky ever
      tell you <i>how</i> Rabbits-Eggs came to rock King that night?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Dick Four. Then McTurk told. &ldquo;I see,&rdquo; said Dick Four, nodding.
      &ldquo;Practically he duplicated that trick over again. There's nobody like
      Stalky.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's just where you make the mistake,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;India's full of
      Stalkies&mdash;Cheltenham and Haileybury and Marlborough chaps&mdash;that
      we don't know anything about, and the surprises will begin when there is
      really a big row on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who will be surprised?&rdquo; said Dick Four.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The other side. The gentlemen who go to the front in first-class
      carriages. Just imagine Stalky let loose on the south side of Europe with
      a sufficiency of Sikhs and a reasonable prospect of loot. Consider it
      quietly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's something in that, but you're too much of an optimist, Beetle,&rdquo;
       said the Infant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I've a right to be. Ain't I responsible for the whole thing? You
      needn't laugh. Who wrote 'Aladdin now has got his wife'&mdash;eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's that got to do with it?&rdquo; said Tertius.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Everything,&rdquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Prove it,&rdquo; said the Infant.
    </p>
    <p>
      And I have.

collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
&ldquo;Defects,&rdquo; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
